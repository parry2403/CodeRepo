DVA folder contains all the code.
Go to target and run :
java -cp DVA-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.gatech.student.assignment.DVA.DataCollection

Run it on windows platforms
Note: Current Target location is hard coded at C:\\tracks.csv and C:\\tracks_sim.csv
It takes arnd 3 -4 minutes to get all 100 records. I have added delay to avoid conflict.

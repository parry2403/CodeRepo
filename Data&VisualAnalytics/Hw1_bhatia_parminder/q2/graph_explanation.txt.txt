In order to make graph more informative, I first added the filter for degree and removed nodes with edges less than 4, as Degree range was from 1 to 31, so 4 to 31 would give fair idea about the data and would remove scattered and infrequent nodes.
I have also done color grading in green and its intensity depends on the degree of the nodes.
In order for data to make more sense , I have used Atlas 2 as layout which gives 3d view of data and provides insights which are far greater than the earlier ones. Graph was then rotated by 45 degrees to as to provide the view, such that 2 clusters could be made visible. I also used expansion layout to expand the data. 
I have increased the  size of top 5 nodes with highest degree and also gave separate colors to them. Red is the biggest .Rest are colored blue. I have colored all the connected components of the highest degree node also as red , which provides insights into its connections and some high degree nodes which are also connected to biggest node are colored magenta.

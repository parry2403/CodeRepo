Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega may have accomplished over the weekend what his U.S. antagonists have failed to do:@#%^&*1
revive a constituency for the Contra rebels.@#%^&*1
Lawmakers haven't publicly raised the possibility@#%^&*2
of renewing military aid to the Contras,@#%^&*2
and President Bush parried the question at a news conference here Saturday,@#%^&*2
saying only@#%^&*2
that@#%^&*2
"if there's an all-out military offensive,@#%^&*2
that's going to change the equation 180 degrees."@#%^&*2
But Mr. Ortega's threat over the weekend@#%^&*3
to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels@#%^&*3
seeking to topple him,@#%^&*3
effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority@#%^&*3
just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters.@#%^&*3
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell@#%^&*4
(D., Maine)@#%^&*4
said yesterday on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press"@#%^&*4
that Mr. Ortega's threat was "a very unwise move, particularly the timing of it."@#%^&*4
The threat came during a two-day celebration in Costa Rica@#%^&*5
to highlight Central America's progress toward democracy in the region,@#%^&*5
attended by President Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 14 other Western Hemisphere leaders.@#%^&*5
Mr. Bush returned to Washington Saturday night.@#%^&*6
Mr. Ortega announced on Friday@#%^&*7
that he would end the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic Contra assaults against his army.@#%^&*7
Saturday, he amended his remarks@#%^&*8
to say@#%^&*8
that he would continue to abide by the cease-fire@#%^&*8
if the U.S. ends its financial support for the Contras.@#%^&*8
He asked@#%^&*9
that the remaining U.S. humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels.@#%^&*9
Not only did Mr. Ortega's comments come in the midst of what was intended as a showcase for the region,@#%^&*10
it came@#%^&*10
as Nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections.@#%^&*10
Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua@#%^&*11
to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates.@#%^&*11
And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November@#%^&*12
if the Contras are to receive the rest of the $49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement@#%^&*12
reached with the Bush administration in March.@#%^&*12
The humanitarian assistance,@#%^&*13
which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels@#%^&*13
amassed along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras,@#%^&*13
replaced the military aid@#%^&*13
cut off by Congress in February 1988.@#%^&*13
While few lawmakers anticipated@#%^&*14
that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month,@#%^&*14
Mr. Ortega's threat practically guarantees@#%^&*14
that the humanitarian aid will be continued.@#%^&*14
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole@#%^&*15
(R., Kan.)@#%^&*15
said yesterday on "Meet the Press":@#%^&*15
"I would hope@#%^&*15
after his {Mr. Ortega's} act yesterday or the day before, we'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid."@#%^&*15
Sen. Dole also said@#%^&*16
he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution@#%^&*16
he plans to offer tomorrow@#%^&*16
denouncing the Nicaraguan leader.@#%^&*16
While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question,@#%^&*17
rejected by Congress@#%^&*17
and de-emphasized by the Bush administration,@#%^&*17
Mr. Ortega's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity@#%^&*17
to press the administration on the issue.@#%^&*17
"The administration should now state@#%^&*18
that@#%^&*18
if the {February} election is voided by the Sandinistas . . .@#%^&*18
they should call for military aid,"@#%^&*19
said former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams.@#%^&*19
"In these circumstances, I think they'd win."@#%^&*20
Sen. Mitchell said@#%^&*21
that congressional Democrats intend to honor the March agreement@#%^&*21
to give non-lethal support to the Contras through the February elections,@#%^&*21
although he added@#%^&*21
that the agreement requires@#%^&*21
that the Contras not initiate any military action.@#%^&*21
Mr. Ortega's threat@#%^&*22
to breach the cease-fire@#%^&*22
comes@#%^&*22
as U.S. officials were acknowledging@#%^&*22
that the Contras have at times violated it themselves.@#%^&*22
Secretary of State James Baker,@#%^&*23
who accompanied President Bush to Costa Rica,@#%^&*23
told reporters Friday:@#%^&*23
"I have no reason@#%^&*23
to deny reports@#%^&*23
that some Contras ambushed some Sandinista soldiers."@#%^&*23
Mr. Baker's assistant for inter-American affairs, Bernard Aronson,@#%^&*24
while maintaining@#%^&*24
that the Sandinistas had also broken the cease-fire,@#%^&*24
acknowledged:@#%^&*24
"It's never very clear who starts what."@#%^&*24
He added@#%^&*25
that the U.S. has cut off aid to some rebel units@#%^&*25
when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire.@#%^&*25
In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid,@#%^&*26
Mr. Ortega's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government@#%^&*26
that he is searching for ways@#%^&*26
to manipulate or void the February elections.@#%^&*26
Administration officials@#%^&*27
traveling with President Bush in Costa Rica@#%^&*27
interpreted Mr. Ortega's wavering as a sign@#%^&*27
that he isn't responding to the military attacks so much@#%^&*27
as he is searching for ways@#%^&*27
to strengthen his hand prior to the elections.@#%^&*27
Mr. Abrams said@#%^&*28
that Mr. Ortega is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections@#%^&*28
to remove any pressure@#%^&*28
to hold fair elections.@#%^&*28
"My sense is what they have in mind is an excuse@#%^&*29
for clamping down on campaigning"@#%^&*29
by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency,@#%^&*29
he said.@#%^&*29

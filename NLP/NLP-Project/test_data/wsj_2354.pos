Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts@#%^&*NNS	IN	NNS	IN	JJ	NNS	CC	NN	NNS	VBP	VBG	DT	JJ	NN	IN	PRP$	NNS	
to defuse suits@#%^&*TO	VB	NNS	
filed by borrowers, developers and creditors.@#%^&*VBN	IN	NNS	,	NNS	CC	NNS	.	
The thrifts' lawyers claim@#%^&*DT	NNS	POS	NNS	VBP	
that the suits,@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	,	
numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone,@#%^&*NN	CD	TO	CD	IN	NNP	RB	,	
should be dismissed as moot@#%^&*MD	VB	VBN	IN	NN	
because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money@#%^&*IN	CC	DT	NNP	CC	NNP	CC	DT	JJ	NNP	NNP	CC	NNP	NNP	NNP	VBZ	DT	NN	
to pay judgments.@#%^&*TO	VB	NNS	.	
Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it,@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	MD	VB	DT	JJ	NN	TO	PRP	,	
even the S&L lawyers concede there's little precedent to back their position.@#%^&*RB	DT	NN	CC	NN	NNS	VBP	EX	POS	JJ	NN	TO	VB	PRP$	NN	.	
Still, one federal appeals court has signaled@#%^&*RB	,	CD	JJ	NNS	NN	VBZ	VBN	
it's willing to entertain the notion,@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	JJ	TO	VB	DT	NN	,	
and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states@#%^&*CC	DT	NNS	VBP	VBN	PRP$	NNS	IN	NNP	CC	CD	JJ	NNS

The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas@#%^&*DT	NN	IN	DT	VBG	NNS	MD	VB	DT	JJ	NN	IN	VBG	NN	NNS	IN	NNP	
and reducing the FSLIC's massive legal bills,@#%^&*CC	VBG	DT	NNP	POS	JJ	JJ	NNS	,	
which topped $73 million last year.@#%^&*WDT	VBD	$	CD	CD	JJ	NN	.	
The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases@#%^&*DT	NN	CC	NN	NNS	VBD	VBN	JJ	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	IN	CD	NNS	
brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch,@#%^&*VBN	IN	JJ	NNP	NNP	CC	NNP	NNP	IN	NNP	IN	DT	NNS	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	,

Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch.@#%^&*NNP	VBD	IN	DT	NN	.	
Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals@#%^&*NNP	CC	DT	NNP	VBD	TO	DT	NNP	NNP	.	NNP	NNP	IN	NNPS	
"that there will never be any assets@#%^&*``	IN	EX	MD	RB	VB	DT	NNS

"this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds."@#%^&*``	DT	NN	MD	VB	NN	IN	DT	NNS	IN	JJ	NNS	.	''	
But the court said@#%^&*CC	DT	NN	VBD	
it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC@#%^&*PRP	VBD	RB	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	CC	DT	NN	
and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas.@#%^&*CC	VBD	DT	NNS	RB	TO	JJ	NN	NN	IN	NNP	.	
Charles Haworth, a lawyer for Sunbelt, says@#%^&*NNP	NNP	,	DT	NN	IN	NNP	,	VBZ	
he plans to file a brief this week@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	TO	VB	DT	NN	DT	NN	
urging the district judge to dismiss the suits,@#%^&*VBG	DT	NN	NN	TO	VB	DT	NNS	,

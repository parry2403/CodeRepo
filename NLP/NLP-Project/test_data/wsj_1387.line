Yet another political scandal is racking Japan.@#%^&*1
But this time it's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party members.@#%^&*2
And@#%^&*3
as it unfolds,@#%^&*3
it's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society.@#%^&*3
Already, ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands@#%^&*4
that opposition members testify under oath in parliament@#%^&*4
have stalled one budget committee session@#%^&*4
and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month.@#%^&*4
But the scandal itself is so convoluted@#%^&*5
that ruling-party members are divided between those@#%^&*5
who want to pursue the matter in hope@#%^&*5
of undermining the opposition@#%^&*5
and those@#%^&*5
who favor leaving well enough alone.@#%^&*5
"The opposition can be the most hurt@#%^&*6
because everyone already figures@#%^&*6
the LDP is that kind of beast,"@#%^&*6
says Shigezo Hayasaka, former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst.@#%^&*6
But,@#%^&*7
he adds,@#%^&*7
"We can't tell@#%^&*7
where it will go at all@#%^&*7
because we're still in the middle of it."@#%^&*7
This time, the scandal centers on donations@#%^&*8
made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry.@#%^&*8
Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling.@#%^&*9
The donations so far appear to be small,@#%^&*10
especially compared with the huge sums@#%^&*10
that changed hands in the Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal@#%^&*10
that plagued the ruling party last year.@#%^&*10
But the implications could be great.@#%^&*11
Pachinko is slightly on the shady side,@#%^&*12
often linked to the lower ranks of Japan's underworld@#%^&*12
and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders.@#%^&*12
Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions,@#%^&*13
and political donations may have been made with the intent@#%^&*13
to bribe.@#%^&*13
Also, about 60% of pachinko parlor owners are Korean,@#%^&*14
many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents' organizations,@#%^&*14
and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan.@#%^&*14
To many Japanese, pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory.@#%^&*15
Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country.@#%^&*16
Devotees pass hours,@#%^&*17
watching the lights blink@#%^&*17
and listening to the metal balls ping,@#%^&*17
as much to gamble@#%^&*17
as to get a little time@#%^&*17
to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts.@#%^&*17
At 500 yen@#%^&*18
($3.60)@#%^&*18
for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime,@#%^&*18
and has been@#%^&*18
since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II.@#%^&*18
But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen@#%^&*19
(almost $92 billion),@#%^&*19
or nearly the size of Japan's vaunted automobile industry.@#%^&*19
And@#%^&*20
because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion,@#%^&*20
some observers estimate@#%^&*20
the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen.@#%^&*20
If that money were being taxed,@#%^&*21
it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen.@#%^&*21
In 1984, an attempt was made@#%^&*22
to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions.@#%^&*22
Then, in 1988, a proposal@#%^&*23
to keep better track of income@#%^&*23
by selling prepaid cards for pachinko@#%^&*23
was fielded in parliament.@#%^&*23
The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin:@#%^&*24
North Koreans oppose the plan@#%^&*24
while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it@#%^&*24
or are neutral.@#%^&*24
In August, a conservative weekly magazine reported@#%^&*25
that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members.@#%^&*25
The magazine alleged@#%^&*26
that@#%^&*26
in making the donations,@#%^&*26
the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes@#%^&*26
to win support in the battle against prepaid cards,@#%^&*26
or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren.@#%^&*26
The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report.@#%^&*27
And at first, neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue.@#%^&*28
But the press kept it alive;@#%^&*29
as with the Recruit scandal, lists began circulating with names of people@#%^&*29
who had received money.@#%^&*29
Within a matter of weeks, less-conservative magazines reported@#%^&*30
that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations.@#%^&*30
So far, though, there have been no allegations@#%^&*31
that the contributions@#%^&*31
the LDP members received@#%^&*31
amounted to bribes.@#%^&*31
Then the two camps upped the ante:@#%^&*32
Reports@#%^&*32
that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members@#%^&*32
were rapidly countered by statements@#%^&*32
that the South Korean residents' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members.@#%^&*32
The JSP admitted Oct. 13@#%^&*33
that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization,@#%^&*33
and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen@#%^&*33
($880,000)@#%^&*33
and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen.@#%^&*33
On Friday, the chief cabinet secretary announced@#%^&*34
that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry,@#%^&*34
including 450,000 yen@#%^&*34
($3,175)@#%^&*34
by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.@#%^&*34
No one has alleged@#%^&*35
that the donations were by themselves illegal.@#%^&*35
Direct donations from either of the residents' organizations would be illegal@#%^&*36
because the groups are defined as foreign,@#%^&*36
but both groups deny making direct donations.@#%^&*36
They say@#%^&*37
its possible some of their members may be donating privately.@#%^&*37
The issue is further complicated@#%^&*38
because@#%^&*38
although the organizations represent Korean residents,@#%^&*38
those residents were largely born and raised in Japan@#%^&*38
and many speak only Japanese.@#%^&*38
That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history@#%^&*39
-- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades@#%^&*39
when Japan occupied Korea before World War II --@#%^&*39
and the discrimination@#%^&*39
that still faces Koreans in Japanese society.@#%^&*39
Many Japanese think it only natural@#%^&*40
that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians, the way@#%^&*40
many Japanese do,@#%^&*40
to win favor or support.@#%^&*40
Both residents' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad.@#%^&*41
But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP's alleged donations,@#%^&*42
implying@#%^&*42
that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean@#%^&*42
because North Korea is communist@#%^&*42
and South Korea is an ally.@#%^&*42

The Big Board says@#%^&*DT	NNP	NNP	VBZ	
program trading describes a variety of strategies@#%^&*NN	NN	VBZ	DT	NN	IN	NNS	
involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks.@#%^&*VBG	DT	NN	CC	NN	IN	DT	NN	IN	CD	CC	JJR	NNS	.	
The most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage,@#%^&*DT	RBS	JJ	IN	DT	VBZ	JJ	NN	,	
in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks@#%^&*IN	WDT	NNS	VBP	CC	VBP	NNS	IN	NNS	
and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures@#%^&*CC	VB	DT	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NN	NNS	
to lock in profits.@#%^&*TO	VB	RP	NNS	.	
It's the most controversial form of program trading@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	DT	RBS	JJ	NN	IN	NN	NN

October employment data@#%^&*1
-- also could turn out to be the most confusing.@#%^&*1
On the surface, the overall unemployment rate is expected to be little changed from September's 5.3%.@#%^&*2
But the actual head count of non-farm employment payroll jobs is likely to be muddied by the impact of Hurricane Hugo, strikes, and less-than-perfect seasonal adjustments,@#%^&*3
economists said.@#%^&*3
The consensus view calls for an overall job gain of 155,000@#%^&*4
compared with September's 209,000 increase.@#%^&*4
But the important factory-jobs segment,@#%^&*5
which last month plunged by 103,000 positions@#%^&*5
and raised recession fears,@#%^&*5
is most likely to be skewed by the month's unusual events.@#%^&*5
Several other reports come before Friday's jobs data,@#%^&*6
including: the September leading indicators index, new-home sales and October agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow; the October purchasing managers' index and September construction spending and manufacturers' orders on Wednesday; and October chain-store sales on Thursday.@#%^&*6
Friday brings the final count on October auto sales.@#%^&*7
"The employment report is going to be difficult to interpret,"@#%^&*8
said Michael Englund, economist with MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York.@#%^&*8
Mr. Englund added@#%^&*9
that next month's data isn't likely to be much better,@#%^&*9
because it will be distorted by San Francisco's earthquake.@#%^&*9
What's more,@#%^&*10
he believes@#%^&*10
seasonal swings in the auto industry this year aren't occurring at the same time as in the past,@#%^&*10
because of production and pricing differences@#%^&*10
that are curbing the accuracy of seasonal adjustments@#%^&*10
built into the employment data.@#%^&*10
Wednesday's report from the purchasing agents will be watched@#%^&*11
to see if the index maintains a level below 50%,@#%^&*11
as it has for the past couple of months.@#%^&*11
A reading of less than 50% indicates an economy@#%^&*12
that is generally contracting@#%^&*12
while a reading above 50% indicates an economy@#%^&*12
that's expanding.@#%^&*12
Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc., Chicago, said@#%^&*13
that the purchasers' report is valuable@#%^&*13
because it often presents the first inkling of economic data for the month.@#%^&*13
But he added:@#%^&*14
"Some people use the purchasers' index as a leading indicator,@#%^&*14
some use it as a coincident indicator.@#%^&*14
But the thing it's supposed to measure@#%^&*15
-- manufacturing strength --@#%^&*15
it missed altogether last month."@#%^&*15
David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., Boston, said@#%^&*16
that the purchasers' index "does miss occasionally,"@#%^&*16
adding:@#%^&*16
"When it misses one month@#%^&*16
it tends to miss the next month, too."@#%^&*16
The consensus view on September leading indicators calls for a gain of 0.3%, the same as in August.@#%^&*17
Economists said@#%^&*18
greatly increased consumer optimism, a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index.@#%^&*18
All orders-related components, such as consumer-goods orders and building permits, are thought to have been weaker.@#%^&*19
Data Resources' Mr. Wyss added@#%^&*20
that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on October chain-store sales.@#%^&*20
Usually, October "isn't a very interesting month {for retail figures}@#%^&*21
because school clothes have been bought@#%^&*21
and people are waiting for December@#%^&*21
to buy Christmas presents,"@#%^&*21
he said.@#%^&*21
But Mr. Wyss said@#%^&*22
he will watch the numbers@#%^&*22
to get an inkling@#%^&*22
of whether consumers' general buying habits may slack off as much@#%^&*22
as their auto-buying apparently has.@#%^&*22
He noted@#%^&*23
that higher gasoline prices will help buoy the October totals.@#%^&*23
Seasonal factors are also expected to have taken their toll on September new-home sales,@#%^&*24
which are believed to have fallen sharply from August's 755,000 units.@#%^&*24
Construction spending is believed to have slipped about 0.5% from August levels,@#%^&*25
although economists noted@#%^&*25
the rate probably will pick up in the months ahead in response to hurricane and earthquake damage.@#%^&*25

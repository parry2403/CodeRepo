in stimulating further trade between the two countries.@#%^&*5
The project will be the largest U.S.-backed joint venture@#%^&*6
to be undertaken in the Soviet Union in recent years.@#%^&*6
One of the hotels,@#%^&*7
to be called the Sheraton Moscow,@#%^&*7
will have 450 rooms@#%^&*7
and will cost an estimated $75 million@#%^&*7
to build.@#%^&*7
The six-story hotel will be on Gorky Street@#%^&*8
and initially will cater mostly to business travelers.@#%^&*8
It will have a Russian tavern, an English pub, a discotheque and Japanese and Italian restaurants,@#%^&*9
according to a Sheraton announcement.@#%^&*9
The hotel is scheduled to open in 1992.@#%^&*10

Details about its size and cost haven't yet been determined.@#%^&*12
Sheraton, a subsidiary of ITT Corp., will have a 40% share in the two hotels;@#%^&*13
Pan American, a subsidiary of Pan Am Corp., will have a 10% share.@#%^&*13
The Soviet owners will be Mossoviet, Moscow's city governing body, and Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline.@#%^&*14
Although a Finnish group has a minority interest in an already operating Moscow hotel,@#%^&*15
the Sheraton-Pan Am venture will be the first joint-venture hotels in the Soviet Union@#%^&*15
to have as much as 50% foreign ownership.@#%^&*15
U.S. companies account for less than 8% of the 1,000 or more Soviet joint ventures@#%^&*16
that have been announced@#%^&*16
since the Soviets began encouraging such undertakings in 1987.@#%^&*16
But some U.S. companies are negotiating projects@#%^&*17
that could be among the biggest ones@#%^&*17
to be launched.@#%^&*17
Chevron Corp., Amoco Corp., Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., and Eastman Kodak Co. are among the U.S. companies@#%^&*18
known to be considering such ventures.@#%^&*18
Sheraton and Pan Am said@#%^&*19
they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law@#%^&*19
that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture.@#%^&*19
The Sheraton Moscow will charge about $140 to $150 a day for each of its rooms,@#%^&*20
and it will accept payment only in currencies@#%^&*20
that can be traded in foreign exchange markets,@#%^&*20
according to a Sheraton executive.@#%^&*20
Thomas Plaskett, Pan Am's chairman, said@#%^&*21
the U.S. airline's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements with Aeroflot@#%^&*21
to jointly operate nonstop New York-Moscow flights.@#%^&*21
He said@#%^&*22
the rising volume of passenger traffic on this route justifies a major investment in new high-standard Moscow hotels.@#%^&*22

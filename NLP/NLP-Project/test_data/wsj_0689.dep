With $150 billion of CDs@#%^&*('$', 'scouring', 'U')	
maturing this month,@#%^&*('maturing', 'CDs', 'U')	('a', 'lot', 'U')	
a lot of people have been scouring the financial landscape for just such an investment.@#%^&*('scouring', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In April,@#%^&*('April', 'yielding', 'U')	
when many of them bought their CDs,@#%^&*('bought', 'yielding', 'U')	
six-month certificates were yielding more than 9%;@#%^&*('yielding', 'ROOT', 'R')	
investors@#%^&*('investors', 'find', 'U')	
willing to look@#%^&*('willing', 'investors', 'U')	
could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts.@#%^&*('find', 'yielding', 'U')	
Now, the nationwide average yield on a six-month CD is just under 8%,@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and 8.5% is about the best around.@#%^&*
But investors@#%^&*('But', 'finding', 'U')	('investors', 'finding', 'U')	
looking for alternatives@#%^&*('looking', 'investors', 'U')	
aren't finding it easy.@#%^&*('finding', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than several months ago.@#%^&*('lower', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And the stock market's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there.@#%^&*('reminder', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"If you're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a CD,@#%^&*('looking', 'going', 'U')	('you', 'going', 'U')	('you', 'find', 'U')	("'re", 'going', 'U')	
you're not going to find it,"@#%^&*('going', 'says', 'U')	
says Washington financial planner Dennis M. Gurtz.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
There are, however, some alternatives@#%^&*('are', 'say', 'U')	
that income-oriented investors should consider,@#%^&*('consider', 'alternatives', 'U')	
investment advisers say.@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Short-term municipal bonds, bond funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices@#%^&*('some', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they mention@#%^&*('mention', 'choices', 'U')

to get a higher return.@#%^&*('get', 'way', 'U')	
In particular,@#%^&*('particular', 'want', 'U')	
advisers say,@#%^&*('say', 'want', 'U')	
investors may want to look at securities@#%^&*('want', 'ROOT', 'R')	('securities', 'reduce', 'U')	
that reduce the risk@#%^&*('reduce', 'securities', 'U')	('that', 'confronting', 'U')	
that CD holders are confronting right now,@#%^&*('confronting', 'reduce', 'U')	
of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short-term certificates at lower rates.@#%^&*('having', 'securities', 'U')	
A mix of CDs and other holdings may make the most sense.@#%^&*('make', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"People should remember@#%^&*('remember', 'says', 'U')	
their money isn't all or nothing@#%^&*('is', 'remember', 'U')

says Bethesda, Md., adviser Karen Schaeffer.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Here's a look at some of the alternatives:@#%^&*('look', 'ROOT', 'R')	
SHORT-TERM MUNICIPALS:@#%^&*('MUNICIPALS', 'look', 'U')	
Investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators.@#%^&*('take', 'look', 'U')	
Yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on CDs for maturities of perhaps one to five years.@#%^&*('higher', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That's because municipal-bond interest is exempt from federal income tax@#%^&*("'s", 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- and from state and local taxes too, for in-state investors.@#%^&*('taxes', 'exempt', 'U')	('too', 'exempt', 'U')	('investors', 'exempt', 'U')	
For an investor@#%^&*('investor', 'paying', 'U')	
paying tax at a 33% rate,@#%^&*('paying', 'equivalent', 'U')	('a', 'yield', 'U')	
a seemingly puny 6% yield on a one-year muni is equivalent to a taxable 9%.@#%^&*('equivalent', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Rates approach 6.5% on five-year municipals.@#%^&*('approach', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Some of the more cautious CD holders might like "pre-refunded" municipals.@#%^&*('like', 'ROOT', 'R')	
These securities get top credit ratings@#%^&*('get', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because the issuers have put aside U.S. bonds@#%^&*('put', 'get', 'U')	('bonds', 'sold', 'U')	('bonds', 'pay', 'U')	
that will be sold@#%^&*('sold', 'bonds', 'U')	
to pay off holders@#%^&*('pay', 'sold', 'U')	
when the municipals are retired.@#%^&*('retired', 'put', 'U')

Consider a "laddered" bond portfolio, with issues@#%^&*('Consider', 'advises', 'U')	('issues', 'advises', 'U')	
maturing in, say, 1992, 1993 and 1994,@#%^&*('maturing', 'issues', 'U')	
advises Malcolm A. Makin, a Westerly, R.I., financial planner.@#%^&*('advises', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates.@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
BOND FUNDS:@#%^&*('FUNDS', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Bond mutual funds offer diversification@#%^&*('funds', 'easy', 'U')	('funds', 'buy', 'U')	('offer', 'FUNDS', 'U')	
and are easy to buy and sell.@#%^&*('easy', 'FUNDS', 'U')	('easy', 'offer', 'U')	
That makes them a reasonable option for investors@#%^&*('makes', 'ROOT', 'R')	('investors', 'accept', 'U')	
who will accept some risk of price fluctuation@#%^&*('accept', 'investors', 'U')	
in order to make a bet@#%^&*('make', 'accept', 'U')

Buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns@#%^&*('look', 'ROOT', 'R')	
if they are right.@#%^&*('right', 'look', 'U')	
But they will have disappointing returns or even losses@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	
if interest rates rise instead.@#%^&*('rise', 'have', 'U')	
Bond resale prices, and thus fund share prices, move in the opposite direction from rates.@#%^&*('move', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The price movements get bigger@#%^&*('bigger', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as the maturity of the securities lengthens.@#%^&*('lengthens', 'bigger', 'U')	
Consider, for instance, two bond funds from Vanguard Group of Investment Cos.@#%^&*('Consider', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that were both yielding 8.6% on a recent day.@#%^&*('yielding', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Short Term Bond Fund, with an average maturity of 2 1/2 years, would deliver a total return for one year of about 10.6%@#%^&*
if rates drop one percentage point@#%^&*
and a one-year return of about 6.6%@#%^&*('years', 'maturity', 'U')	
if rates rise by the same amount.@#%^&*('would', 'deliver', 'U')	
if rates rise by the same amount.@#%^&*
But, in the same circumstances, the returns would be a more extreme 14.6% and 2.6% for the Vanguard Bond Market Fund, with its 12 1/2-year average maturity.@#%^&*('%', 'ROOT', 'R')

If interest rates don't change,@#%^&*('change', 'equal', 'U')	
bond fund investors' returns will be about equal to the funds' current yields.@#%^&*('equal', 'ROOT', 'R')	
DEFERRED ANNUITIES:@#%^&*('ANNUITIES', 'ROOT', 'R')	
These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts:@#%^&*('feature', 'ANNUITIES', 'U')	
Investment gains are compounded@#%^&*('compounded', 'feature', 'U')	
without tax consequences@#%^&*('consequences', 'compounded', 'U')	
until money is withdrawn,@#%^&*('withdrawn', 'compounded', 'U')	('a', 'tax', 'U')

Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities, or certificates of annuity.@#%^&*('Aimed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
An interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years,@#%^&*('guaranteed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('years', 'get', 'U')	
after which holders get 30 days@#%^&*('get', 'years', 'U')	
to choose another guarantee period@#%^&*('choose', 'get', 'U')	('to', 'switch', 'U')

without the surrender charges@#%^&*('charges', 'switch', 'U')	('charges', 'common', 'U')	
that are common to annuities.@#%^&*('common', 'charges', 'U')	
Some current rates exceed those on CDs.@#%^&*('exceed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For instance, a CD-type annuity from North American Co. for Life & Health Insurance, Chicago, offers 8.8% interest for one year or a 9% rate for two years.@#%^&*('offers', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Annuities are rarely a good idea at age 35@#%^&*('idea', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because of the withdrawal restrictions.@#%^&*('restrictions', 'age', 'U')	
But at age 55, "they may be a great deal,"@#%^&*('deal', 'says', 'U')	
says Mr. Wilson, the Columbia, S.C., planner.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
MONEY MARKET FUNDS:@#%^&*('FUNDS', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That's right,@#%^&*('That', 'funds', 'U')	("'s", 'funds', 'U')	('right', 'funds', 'U')

The conventional wisdom is to go into money funds@#%^&*('wisdom', 'shift', 'U')	('is', 'ROOT', 'R')

when rates seem headed down.@#%^&*('seem', 'present', 'U')	
With average maturities of a month or so, money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns@#%^&*('offer', 'ROOT', 'R')	('returns', 'track', 'U')	
that track market interest rates,@#%^&*('track', 'returns', 'U')	('a', 'lag', 'U')

Still, today's highest-yielding money funds may beat CDs over the next year@#%^&*('beat', 'says', 'U')	
even if rates fall,@#%^&*('fall', 'beat', 'U')	
says Guy Witman, an editor of the Bond Market Advisor newsletter in Atlanta.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That's because top-yielding funds currently offer yields almost 1 1/2 percentage points above the average CD yield.@#%^&*("'s", 'ROOT', 'R')	
That's because top-yielding funds currently offer yields almost 1 1/2 percentage points above the average CD yield.@#%^&*

suggests Back Bay Advisors Inc., a mutual fund unit of New England Insurance Co.@#%^&*('suggests', 'ROOT', 'R')

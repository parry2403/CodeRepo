The Polish rat will eat well this winter.@#%^&*1
Tons of delectably rotting potatoes, barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land@#%^&*2
as thousands of farmers turn the state's buyers away.@#%^&*2
Many a piglet won't be born as a result,@#%^&*3
and many a ham will never hang in a butcher shop.@#%^&*3
But with inflation raging,@#%^&*4
grain in the barn will still be a safer bet for the private farmer than money in the bank.@#%^&*4
Once again, the indomitable peasant holds Poland's future in his hands.@#%^&*5
Until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system,@#%^&*6
even Solidarity's sympathetic new government won't win him over.@#%^&*6
In coming months, emergency food aid@#%^&*7
moving in from the West@#%^&*7
will be the one buffer between a meat-hungry public and a new political calamity.@#%^&*7
Factory workers on strike knocked Poland's Communist bosses off balance last year;@#%^&*8
this year, it was the farmers@#%^&*8
who brought them down.@#%^&*8
In June, farmers held onto meat, milk and grain,@#%^&*9
waiting for July's usual state-directed price rises.@#%^&*9
The Communists froze prices instead.@#%^&*10
The farmers ran a boycott,@#%^&*11
and meat disappeared from the shops.@#%^&*11
On Aug. 1, the state tore up its controls,@#%^&*12
and food prices leaped.@#%^&*12
Without buffer stocks,@#%^&*13
inflation exploded.@#%^&*13
That was when the tame old Peasants' Party, desperate to live through the crisis, broke ranks with the Communists@#%^&*14
and joined with Solidarity in the East Bloc's first liberated government.@#%^&*14
But by the time Solidarity took office in September,@#%^&*15
the damage was done.@#%^&*15
"Shortageflation,"@#%^&*16
as economists have come to call it,@#%^&*16
had gone hyper.@#%^&*16
The cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one.@#%^&*17
The farmers stayed angry.@#%^&*18
They still are.@#%^&*19
At dawn on a cool day, hundreds travel to the private market in Radzymin, a town not far from Warsaw,@#%^&*20
hauling pigs, cattle and sacks of feed@#%^&*20
that the state's official buyers can't induce them to sell.@#%^&*20
Here, they are searching for a higher price.@#%^&*21
In a crush of trucks and horse carts on the trodden field, Andrzej Latowski wrestles a screeching, overweight hog into the trunk of a private butcher's Polish Fiat.@#%^&*22
"Of course it's better to sell private,"@#%^&*23
he says,@#%^&*23
as the butcher trundles away.@#%^&*23
"Why should anybody want to sell to them?"@#%^&*24
The young farmer makes money on the few hogs@#%^&*24
he sells here.@#%^&*24
He won't for long,@#%^&*25
because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up.@#%^&*25
"There's no feed,"@#%^&*26
he says.@#%^&*26
"You can't buy anything nowadays.@#%^&*27
I don't know why."@#%^&*28
Edward Chojnowski does.@#%^&*29
His truck is parked across the field, in a row of grain sellers.@#%^&*30
Like the others, it is loaded with rye, wheat and oats in sacks@#%^&*31
labeled "Asbestos.@#%^&*31
Made in U.S.S.R."@#%^&*32
The farmer at the next truck shouts,@#%^&*33
"Wheat!@#%^&*33
It's nice!@#%^&*33
It won't be cheaper!@#%^&*33
We sell direct!"@#%^&*33
A heavy, kerchiefed woman runs a handful through her fingers,@#%^&*33
and counts him out a pile of zlotys.@#%^&*33
"Country people breed pigs,"@#%^&*34
says Mr. Chojnowski,@#%^&*34
leaning against the back of his truck.@#%^&*34
"They can't buy feed from the state.@#%^&*35
There isn't enough.@#%^&*36
Some state middlemen come to buy from me.@#%^&*37
I sell@#%^&*38
-- a little.@#%^&*38
I am waiting.@#%^&*39
I have plenty more at home."@#%^&*40
On this morning, he doesn't sell much in Radzymin, either.@#%^&*41
At closing time, farmers cart out most of what they carted in.@#%^&*42
A private market like this just isn't big enough@#%^&*43
to absorb all that business.@#%^&*43
The hulk of Stalinism,@#%^&*44
it seems,@#%^&*44
will not quickly crumble away.@#%^&*44
State monopolies will keep on stifling trade, "free" prices or not,@#%^&*45
until something else replaces them.@#%^&*45
Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement, processing and distribution@#%^&*46
-- plus a new manufacturing industry@#%^&*46
to supply it with tractors, pesticides, fertilizers and feed.@#%^&*46
The Communists spent 40 years@#%^&*47
working@#%^&*47
to ensure@#%^&*47
that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here.@#%^&*47
Building them now will require undergirding from the West, and removal of political deadwood, a job@#%^&*48
that Solidarity has barely started.@#%^&*48
But Polish agriculture does possess one great asset already:@#%^&*49
the private farmer.@#%^&*49
"We are dealing with real entrepreneurs,"@#%^&*50
says Antoni Leopold, an economist@#%^&*50
who advises Rural Solidarity, the union's countryside offshoot.@#%^&*50
"There are a lot of them,@#%^&*51
and they have property."@#%^&*51
Polish peasants,@#%^&*52
spurning the collectivizers,@#%^&*52
were once a source of shame to orthodox Communists.@#%^&*52
Now, among Communist reformers, they are objects of envy.@#%^&*53
Food is the reformer's top priority, the key to popular support.@#%^&*54
As the Chinese have shown@#%^&*55
and the Soviets are learning,@#%^&*55
family farms thrive@#%^&*55
where collectives fail.@#%^&*55
Ownership,@#%^&*56
it seems,@#%^&*56
is the best fertilizer.@#%^&*56
The Poles have had it all along.@#%^&*57
Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76% of its arable land.@#%^&*58
On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes.@#%^&*59
Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation.@#%^&*60
Try as they might,@#%^&*61
the Communists could neither replace nor break him.@#%^&*61
And they did try.@#%^&*62
A few miles past Radzymin, a dirt road narrows to a track of sand@#%^&*63
and leads into Zalubice, a village of tumbledown farms.@#%^&*63
Czeslaw Pyszkiewicz owns 30 acres in 14 scattered scraps.@#%^&*64
He grows rye and potatoes for a few hens, five cows and 25 piglets.@#%^&*65
In patched pants and torn shoes, he stands in his barnyard@#%^&*66
eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sardonic.@#%^&*66
"It's bad soil,"@#%^&*67
he says.@#%^&*67
Until 1963, it was good soil.@#%^&*68
Then the state put in a reservoir@#%^&*69
to supply the area with drinking water.@#%^&*69
Farmers lay down before the bulldozers.@#%^&*70
Their protest was ignored.@#%^&*71
The dam caused the water level to drop in Zalubice.@#%^&*72
Mr Pyszkiewicz smiles and his brow furrows.@#%^&*73
He expected as much.@#%^&*74
In his lifetime, 47 years, the Communists brought electricity to his village@#%^&*75
and piped in drinking water from the reservoir.@#%^&*75
No phones.@#%^&*76
No gas.@#%^&*77
"We wanted them to build a road here,"@#%^&*78
he says.@#%^&*78
"They started,@#%^&*79
and then abandoned it."@#%^&*79
A tractor, his only mechanized equipment, stands in front of the pigsty.@#%^&*80
"It's Russian.@#%^&*81
Good for nothing.@#%^&*82
Parts are a tragedy.@#%^&*83
Even if I had a lot of money,@#%^&*84
I couldn't buy what I need."@#%^&*84
The farmer can say the same for coal, cement, saw blades.@#%^&*85
In Poland, only 4% of all investment goes toward making things farmers want;@#%^&*86
in the West, it is closer to 20%.@#%^&*86
The few big state farms take first crack at what does get made.@#%^&*87
They use 60% more fertilizer per acre, twice the high-grade feed.@#%^&*88
Yet their best boast is that they produce 32% of Polish pork.@#%^&*89
"I've heard from friends@#%^&*90
that state farms are subsidized,"@#%^&*90
Mr. Pyszkiewicz says@#%^&*90
as his wife, Wieslawa, sets some chairs out in the sun.@#%^&*90
"We have one near here.@#%^&*91
There is a lot of waste.@#%^&*92
A private farmer never wastes anything."@#%^&*93
The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago.@#%^&*94
But it never did let up on the pressure.@#%^&*95
Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land@#%^&*96
to collect his pension.@#%^&*96
The pension's size still depends on how much produce@#%^&*97
he sells the state.@#%^&*97
His allotment of materials also did,@#%^&*98
until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain.@#%^&*98
Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines.@#%^&*99
When supplies are short,@#%^&*100
it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain.@#%^&*100
A private farmer in Poland is free to buy and sell land, hire help, decide what to grow and how to grow it.@#%^&*101
He is free to invest in chickens,@#%^&*102
and to fail for lack of chicken wire.@#%^&*102
He has plenty of freedom@#%^&*103
-- but no choices.@#%^&*103
"I'm on my own land,"@#%^&*104
Mr. Pyszkiewicz says.@#%^&*104
"I don't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do."@#%^&*105
"Sometimes,"@#%^&*106
says his wife,@#%^&*106
"we're happy about that."@#%^&*106
By starving the peasant,@#%^&*107
the Communists have starved Poland.@#%^&*107
Villages like Zalubice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors.@#%^&*108
Farm income is 15% below the average.@#%^&*109
The young leave, especially girls@#%^&*110
who won't milk cows by hand.@#%^&*110
Some men stay, their best friend a bottle of vodka,@#%^&*111
but two million acres have gone fallow.@#%^&*111
Without machines,@#%^&*112
good farms can't get bigger.@#%^&*112
So the potato crop, once 47 million tons, is down to 35 million.@#%^&*113
Meat consumption is at 1979's level,@#%^&*114
pork production at 1973's,@#%^&*114
milk output at 1960's.@#%^&*114
If a food crisis undid the Communists,@#%^&*115
a food revolution will make Solidarity.@#%^&*115
The potential is displayed along every road into Warsaw:@#%^&*116
row upon row of greenhouses,@#%^&*116
stretching out behind modern mansions@#%^&*116
that trumpet their owners' wealth.@#%^&*116
Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland,@#%^&*117
the pickles and sauerkraut sublime,@#%^&*117
the state monopolies long broken.@#%^&*117
Grain, milk and meat come next.@#%^&*118
A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money@#%^&*119
than Poland can spare,@#%^&*119
although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast.@#%^&*119
Poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale.@#%^&*120
Solidarity wants it from the West.@#%^&*121
Maria Stolzman, one of its farm experts, lays it on the line:@#%^&*122
"The World Bank will be brought in@#%^&*122
to help us destroy the old system."@#%^&*122
Felix Siemienas is destroying it now.@#%^&*123
He packs pork.@#%^&*124
A law went on the books in January@#%^&*125
that let him smoke bacon@#%^&*125
without breeding pigs.@#%^&*125
He cashed in.@#%^&*126
Poland is short on enterprises, not enterprise.@#%^&*127
"I pay a lot to the farmer and five times the state salary to my employees,"@#%^&*128
he says.@#%^&*128
He is in Warsaw@#%^&*129
to open a shop.@#%^&*129
"I hire transportation,@#%^&*130
and my customers have fresh cold cuts every day.@#%^&*130
I don't subsidize anyone.@#%^&*131
Everyone around me lives well.@#%^&*132
Yes, my prices are high.@#%^&*133
If nobody buys,@#%^&*134
I bring my prices down.@#%^&*134
That's the rule.@#%^&*135
That's the market."@#%^&*136
Mr. Siemienas is making a fortune@#%^&*137
-- $10,000 a month,@#%^&*137
he says.@#%^&*137
He has bought some trendy Western clothes, and a green Mercedes with an American flag in the window.@#%^&*138
But the meat-processing machines@#%^&*139
he picked up@#%^&*139
are 50 years old.@#%^&*139
"I don't want expensive machines.@#%^&*140
If the situation changes,@#%^&*141
I'll get stuck with them."@#%^&*141
That's politics.@#%^&*142
By taking power in a deal with the Peasant Party's onetime Communist stooges,@#%^&*143
Solidarity has spooked the rural entrepreneur.@#%^&*143
Rural Solidarity objected, to no avail,@#%^&*144
when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa accepted the Peasants' support.@#%^&*144
It objected again in September@#%^&*145
when Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki reluctantly named a Peasant Party man as his agriculture minister.@#%^&*145
Both the Peasants and Rural Solidarity are forming new political parties for farmers.@#%^&*146
The Peasants can make a credible case, against Solidarity,@#%^&*147
that hell-bent reform will drive millions from the land.@#%^&*147
Next Spring, the two will battle in local elections.@#%^&*148
But until then, and probably long afterward, the Communists' apparat of obstruction@#%^&*149
-- from the head of the dairy co-op to the village bank manager --@#%^&*149
will stay planted in the Polish countryside.@#%^&*149
"We know how to get from capitalism to socialism,"@#%^&*150
Sergiusz Niciporuk is saying one afternoon.@#%^&*150
"We don't know how to get from socialism to capitalism."@#%^&*151
He farms 12 acres in Grabowiec, two miles from the Soviet border in one of Poland's poorest places.@#%^&*152
Now he is mounting the steps of a stucco building in a nearby village, on a visit to the Communist administrator, the "naczelnik."@#%^&*153
"Many people in Poland hope@#%^&*154
this government will break down,"@#%^&*154
says Mr. Niciporuk,@#%^&*154
who belongs to the local council and to Rural Solidarity.@#%^&*154
"That's what the naczelnik counts on.@#%^&*155
He is our most dangerous enemy.@#%^&*156
Every time he sees me,@#%^&*157
he gets very nervous."@#%^&*157
The farmer barges into the naczelnik's office.@#%^&*158
A thin man in a gray suit looks up from a newspaper.@#%^&*159
Mr. Niciporuk sits.@#%^&*160
Anatol Pawlowski's leg begins jiggling beneath his desk.@#%^&*161
"Solidarity doesn't care for the good of this region,"@#%^&*162
he says after a few pleasantries.@#%^&*162
"They want to turn everything upside down in a week.@#%^&*163
Mr. Niciporuk here wants 60 acres@#%^&*164
used at the moment by a state farm.@#%^&*164
He can't guarantee@#%^&*165
that he can use it any better."@#%^&*165
"I am ready at any moment to compete with a state farm."@#%^&*166
The naczelnik averts his eyes.@#%^&*167
"What have you got?@#%^&*168
Not even a tractor.@#%^&*168
And you want to make wicker baskets, too."@#%^&*169
"I can do five things at once@#%^&*170
-- to be a businessman."@#%^&*170
"Big business,"@#%^&*171
Mr. Pawlowski snorts in English.@#%^&*171
The farmer stands to go.@#%^&*172
The naczelnik stands, too.@#%^&*173
"I care very much for this post,"@#%^&*174
he says.@#%^&*174
"Eight years I've had it.@#%^&*175
A cultural center has been built, shops.@#%^&*176
Suddenly, I am not a comfortable man for Solidarity.@#%^&*177
I have accomplished too much.@#%^&*178
They want to do more.@#%^&*179
I wish them all the best!"@#%^&*180
The farmer leaves.@#%^&*180
And the naczelnik shuts his door.@#%^&*181

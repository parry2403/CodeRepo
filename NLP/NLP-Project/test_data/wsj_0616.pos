Some analysts are concerned, however,@#%^&*DT	NNS	VBP	VBN	,	RB	,	
that Banco Exterior may have waited too long@#%^&*IN	NNP	NNP	MD	VB	VBN	RB	RB

Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services,@#%^&*VBG	RP	IN	JJ	NNS	IN	JJ	NN	CC	JJ	NNS	,

If that proves true,@#%^&*IN	DT	VBZ	JJ	,	
analysts say@#%^&*NNS	VBP	
Banco Exterior could be a prime partner@#%^&*NNP	NNP	MD	VB	DT	JJ	NN

Mr. Luzon and his team, however, say@#%^&*NNP	NNP	CC	PRP$	NN	,	RB	,	VBP	
they aren't interested in a merger.@#%^&*PRP	VBP	RB	JJ	IN	DT	NN	.

Mr. Luzon says.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBZ	.	
Banco Exterior was created in 1929@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	VBN	IN	CD	
to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports.@#%^&*TO	VB	JJ	NNS	IN	JJ	NNS	.	
The market for export financing was liberalized in the mid-1980s, however,@#%^&*DT	NN	IN	NN	NN	VBD	VBN	IN	DT	NNS	,	RB	,	
forcing the bank to face competition.@#%^&*VBG	DT	NN	TO	VB	NN	.	
At the same time, many of Spain's traditional export markets in Latin America and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth.@#%^&*IN	DT	JJ	NN	,	JJ	IN	NNP	POS	JJ	NN	NNS	IN	NNP	NNP	CC	JJ	VBG	NNS	VBD	DT	JJ	NN	IN	JJ	NN	.	
As a result, the volume of Banco Exterior's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	,	DT	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	POS	NN	NN	NN	VBD	IN	CD	CD	NNS

Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November,@#%^&*IN	NNP	NNP	VBD	DT	NN	JJ	NNP	,	
Banco Exterior was run by politicians@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	VBN	IN	NNS

Though Spain has an excess of banks,@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBZ	DT	NN	IN	NNS	,

the country still has one of the most profitable markets in Europe,@#%^&*DT	NN	RB	VBZ	CD	IN	DT	RBS	JJ	NNS	IN	NNP	,

As Helen Boehm,@#%^&*1
who owns an art porcelain company,@#%^&*1
sipped her luncheon cocktail,@#%^&*1
she reeled off the names of a few pals@#%^&*1
-- Prince Charles, Princess Diana, Sarah Ferguson, John Kluge, Milton Petrie.@#%^&*1
Then,@#%^&*2
flashing a diamond ring as big as the Ritz@#%^&*2
("my day diamond, darling"),@#%^&*2
she told her two companions@#%^&*2
that she is on the "board" of the Vatican Museum in Rome.@#%^&*2
As it turns out,@#%^&*3
the board has a lot of important members,@#%^&*3
including Winton Blount@#%^&*3
(former postmaster general of the U.S.),@#%^&*3
Mrs. Henry Gaisman@#%^&*3
(widow of the inventor of auto-strop razor)@#%^&*3
and Vincent Murphy@#%^&*3
(an investment banker at Merrill Lynch & Co.)@#%^&*3
But Mrs. Boehm didn't mention any of them.@#%^&*3
"Helen Boehm has a way with names,"@#%^&*4
says James Revson, a gossip columnist for Newsday@#%^&*4
(and son of Joseph Revson, a founder of Revlon).@#%^&*4
Like which are droppable and which are not.@#%^&*5
With the fall social season well under way, name-droppers are out in force,@#%^&*6
trying to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers.@#%^&*6
But the truth is that almost everyone, from real-estate agents to city fathers, name-drops;@#%^&*7
and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle@#%^&*7
who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist@#%^&*7
who did the Katzenjammer Kids.@#%^&*7
(In case you have forgotten,@#%^&*8
his name was Rudolph Dirks.)@#%^&*8
"Name-dropping is pervasive@#%^&*8
and getting more so@#%^&*8
as society becomes more complex and alienating,"@#%^&*8
says Herbert Freudenberger, a New York psychoanalyst, with a high-powered clientele.@#%^&*8
"It can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society. . . .@#%^&*9
It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation@#%^&*10
and can help open up a conversation with someone@#%^&*10
you don't know."@#%^&*10
Like the Long Island matron in the theater district the other day@#%^&*11
who swore to a stranger@#%^&*11
that she once met Liza Minnelli.@#%^&*11
"I was having a drink in Sardi's,@#%^&*12
when all of a sudden I saw a woman's backside@#%^&*12
coming up the steps on the second floor@#%^&*12
and she was wearing sequined slacks.@#%^&*12
I knew@#%^&*13
it was someone important,@#%^&*13
so I followed her into the ladies room@#%^&*13
and sure enough, it was Liza.@#%^&*13
So I said,@#%^&*14
`Hello. '@#%^&*14
And she said,@#%^&*14
`Hello. '@#%^&*14
Can you imagine?@#%^&*14
Liza said hello to me."@#%^&*14
Some people must drop names@#%^&*15
-- call it an irresistible impulse.@#%^&*15
"They can't help talking about the big important people@#%^&*16
they know,@#%^&*16
even if they don't really know them,"@#%^&*16
says Dr. Freudenberger.@#%^&*16
Beauregard Houston-Montgomery, a New York writer@#%^&*17
who changed his name from William Stretch in 1980,@#%^&*17
is an inveterate name-dropper.@#%^&*17
"I do it innately and pathologically,@#%^&*18
and@#%^&*18
while it may occasionally get me into trouble,@#%^&*18
it's also gotten me access to parties and society,"@#%^&*18
he says.@#%^&*18
Name-dropping recently helped Mr. Houston-Montgomery crash a party@#%^&*19
Fame magazine threw for 100 of the 2,809 people@#%^&*19
mentioned in the diaries of the late Andy Warhol.@#%^&*19
"I guess@#%^&*20
I might have asked Beauregard to leave,@#%^&*20
but he drops so many good names,@#%^&*20
we decided to let him stay,"@#%^&*20
says Steven Greenberg, publisher of Fame.@#%^&*20
"After all, Warhol was the ultimate namedropper,@#%^&*21
dropping five a day in his diaries.@#%^&*21
And Beauregard was mentioned twice@#%^&*22
-- although very briefly and in passing."@#%^&*22
Mr. Houston-Montgomery says@#%^&*23
that at the party he waved to Malcolm Forbes, publisher of Forbes magazine@#%^&*23
("We've been in the columns together"),@#%^&*23
Mary Boone, a New York art dealer@#%^&*23
("I think@#%^&*23
she knows me,@#%^&*23
but I'm not sure ")@#%^&*23
and Bridget Fonda, the actress@#%^&*23
("She knows me,@#%^&*23
but we're not really the best of friends").@#%^&*23
Mr. Revson, the gossip columnist, says@#%^&*24
there are people@#%^&*24
who actually plan whose names they are going to drop@#%^&*24
before attending a party.@#%^&*24
These droppers don't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps, Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher.@#%^&*25
"They even drop semi-obscure names like Wolfgang Flottl,@#%^&*26
whom everybody these days apparently has heard of@#%^&*26
but no one really knows,"@#%^&*26
says Mr. Revson.@#%^&*26
"It's the one-upsmanship of name-dropping that counts."@#%^&*27
But name-dropping has other benefits, often civic.@#%^&*28
In the name of civic pride and from the desire@#%^&*29
to nullify a negative image,@#%^&*29
some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names@#%^&*29
the city has to offer.@#%^&*29
Take Cleveland.@#%^&*30
It has gotten a bad rep@#%^&*31
because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire,@#%^&*31
because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch@#%^&*31
and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant.@#%^&*31
Some people call it "The Mistake on the Lake"@#%^&*32
-- Lake Erie, that is.@#%^&*32
"It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top,"@#%^&*33
says George Miller, executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign, a nonprofit organization@#%^&*33
devoted to citing the city's strengths.@#%^&*33
Mr. Miller notes@#%^&*34
that actor Paul Newman's family owned a sporting-goods store in Cleveland,@#%^&*34
that the late actress Margaret Hamilton,@#%^&*34
who played the bad witch in "The Wizard Of Oz,"@#%^&*34
once ran a nursery school in Cleveland@#%^&*34
and that comedian Bob Hope's father, a stonemason, once worked on a church next to Severence Hall, Cleveland's main concert hall.@#%^&*34
"Power names like that don't hurt the city's reputation,"@#%^&*35
Mr. Miller says.@#%^&*35
In Hollywood, an average family can gain cachet@#%^&*36
from moving into a home@#%^&*36
vacated by the famous or near famous.@#%^&*36
"Why we even just sold a three-bedroom house in Van Nuys@#%^&*37
and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real-estate market@#%^&*37
by noting@#%^&*37
that the original Lone Ranger lived there,"@#%^&*37
says David Rambo, a sales associate with Jon Douglas Co., a Los Angeles real-estate agency.@#%^&*37
"Most people can't even remember his name."@#%^&*38
(It is John Hart.)@#%^&*39
Mr. Rambo says@#%^&*39
that a 3.2-acre property@#%^&*39
overlooking the San Fernando Valley@#%^&*39
is priced at $4 million@#%^&*39
because the late actor Erroll Flynn once lived there.@#%^&*39
"If Flynn hadn't lived there,@#%^&*40
the property might have been priced $1 million lower,"@#%^&*40
says Mr. Rambo,@#%^&*40
noting@#%^&*40
that Flynn's house has been bulldozed,@#%^&*40
and only the swimming pool remains.@#%^&*40
Press agents and public-relations practitioners are notorious name-droppers.@#%^&*41
And some even do it with malice aforethought.@#%^&*42
Len Kessler, a financial publicist in New York, sometimes uses it@#%^&*43
to get the attention of journalists@#%^&*43
who try to avoid him.@#%^&*43
He says@#%^&*44
that@#%^&*44
when Dan Dorfman, a financial columnist with USA Today, hasn't returned his phone calls,@#%^&*44
he leaves messages with Mr. Dorfman's office@#%^&*44
saying@#%^&*44
that he has an important story on Donald Trump, Meshulam Riklis or Marvin Davis.@#%^&*44
He admits@#%^&*45
he has no story on any of them on these occasions.@#%^&*45
"But it does get him to return my calls,@#%^&*46
and it makes me feel better for the times@#%^&*46
he's given me the brushoff,"@#%^&*46
Mr. Kessler says.@#%^&*46
There are, of course, obvious dangers to blatant, unsubstantiated name-dropping.@#%^&*47
Jeffry Thal, a publicity agent for the Lantz Office in Los Angeles, warns@#%^&*48
that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud.@#%^&*48
"Get caught@#%^&*49
and you're dead in the water,"@#%^&*49
says Mr. Thal.@#%^&*49
Mr. Thal says@#%^&*50
that Elizabeth Taylor, a client, "hates being called `Liz. '. . .@#%^&*50
If directors or producers phone me@#%^&*51
and say@#%^&*51
they know `Liz, '@#%^&*51
I know@#%^&*51
they've never met her.@#%^&*51
She prefers `Elizabeth.@#%^&*52
'" In New York society, Pat Buckley, the very social wife of author William Buckley, has the nicknames "Mrs. Buckles" and "Patsy."@#%^&*53
And her husband sometimes calls her "Ducky."@#%^&*54
"But call her `Patty, '@#%^&*55
and it's a sure giveaway@#%^&*55
you're not in her circle,@#%^&*55
because she doesn't use that name,"@#%^&*55
says Joan Kron, editor-in-chief of Avenue magazine, a monthly publication@#%^&*55
sent to all the right names.@#%^&*55
John Spencer Churchill, a nephew of the late Sir Winston Churchill, former prime minister of Great Britain, isn't that impressed with most name-droppers@#%^&*56
he meets.@#%^&*56
That's because they only drop "mere names,"@#%^&*57
says Mr. Churchill.@#%^&*57
Currently writing his memoirs,@#%^&*58
Mr. Churchill, an artist, tells how tycoons such as the late Jean Paul Getty, the oil billionnaire, were, in fact, known only by one initial, their last.@#%^&*58
"When you're at the club,@#%^&*59
you ask@#%^&*59
whether they've spoken to `G.'@#%^&*59
Now they know@#%^&*59
who you mean@#%^&*59
and you know@#%^&*59
who you mean.@#%^&*59
But no one else does.@#%^&*60
Now that's name-dropping,@#%^&*61
if you know@#%^&*61
what I mean."@#%^&*61

Call it the "we're too broke@#%^&*1
to fight"@#%^&*1
defense.@#%^&*1
Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts@#%^&*2
to defuse suits@#%^&*2
filed by borrowers, developers and creditors.@#%^&*2
The thrifts' lawyers claim@#%^&*3
that the suits,@#%^&*3
numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone,@#%^&*3
should be dismissed as moot@#%^&*3
because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money@#%^&*3
to pay judgments.@#%^&*3
Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it,@#%^&*4
even the S&L lawyers concede there's little precedent to back their position.@#%^&*4
Still, one federal appeals court has signaled@#%^&*5
it's willing to entertain the notion,@#%^&*5
and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states@#%^&*5
where the defense is permitted under state law.@#%^&*5
The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas@#%^&*6
and reducing the FSLIC's massive legal bills,@#%^&*6
which topped $73 million last year.@#%^&*6
The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases@#%^&*7
brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch,@#%^&*7
best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team.@#%^&*7
Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch.@#%^&*8
Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals@#%^&*9
"that there will never be any assets@#%^&*9
with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings@#%^&*9
nor any means to collect from any other party,@#%^&*9
including FSLIC."@#%^&*9
"If true,"@#%^&*10
the court wrote,@#%^&*10
"this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds."@#%^&*10
But the court said@#%^&*11
it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC@#%^&*11
and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas.@#%^&*11
Charles Haworth, a lawyer for Sunbelt, says@#%^&*12
he plans to file a brief this week@#%^&*12
urging the district judge to dismiss the suits,@#%^&*12
because Sunbelt's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $2 billion@#%^&*12
when federal regulators closed it in August 1988.@#%^&*12
"This institution is just brain dead,"@#%^&*13
says Mr. Haworth, a partner in the Dallas office of Andrews & Kurth, a Houston law firm.@#%^&*13
But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group, the developer of Valley Ranch, dismisses such arguments as a "defense du jour."@#%^&*14
Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says@#%^&*15
a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award,@#%^&*15
including the reversal of Sunbelt's foreclosure on Valley Ranch.@#%^&*15
"We're asking the court for a number of things@#%^&*16
he can grant@#%^&*16
in addition to the thrill of victory,"@#%^&*16
he says.@#%^&*16
"We'd take the Valley Ranch free and clear as a booby prize."@#%^&*17

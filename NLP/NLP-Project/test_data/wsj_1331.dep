GAF, Part III is scheduled to begin today.@#%^&*('scheduled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have changed considerably.@#%^&*('changed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street@#%^&*('watched', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because they were considered to be important tests of the government's ability@#%^&*('considered', 'watched', 'U')	('to', 'convince', 'U')	
to convince a jury of allegations@#%^&*('convince', 'ability', 'U')	
stemming from its insider-trading investigations.@#%^&*('stemming', 'allegations', 'U')	
In an eight-count indictment, the government charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., chemical maker, and Mr. Sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986.@#%^&*('charged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The government's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness, Boyd L. Jefferies, the former Los Angeles brokerage chief@#%^&*('depended', 'ROOT', 'R')	('chief', 'implicated', 'U')	('chief', 'pointed', 'U')	
who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky,@#%^&*('implicated', 'chief', 'U')	
and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin, takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian.@#%^&*('pointed', 'chief', 'U')	('pointed', 'implicated', 'U')	
The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian.@#%^&*('viewed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Jefferies's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But GAF's bellwether role was short-lived.@#%^&*('short', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks@#%^&*('ended', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found@#%^&*('found', 'ended', 'U')	
that a prosecutor improperly, but unintentionally, withheld a document.@#%^&*('withheld', 'found', 'U')	
After 93 hours of deliberation, the jurors in the second trial said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they were hopelessly deadlocked,@#%^&*('deadlocked', 'said', 'U')	
and another mistrial was declared on March 22.@#%^&*('declared', 'said', 'U')	
Meanwhile, a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June.@#%^&*('found', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A month later, Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge@#%^&*('spared', 'ROOT', 'R')	('judge', 'praised', 'U')	
who praised him@#%^&*('praised', 'judge', 'U')	
for helping the government.@#%^&*('helping', 'praised', 'U')	
In August, Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts.@#%^&*('pleaded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Nevertheless, the stakes are still high for the players@#%^&*('high', 'ROOT', 'R')	
directly involved in the GAF case.@#%^&*('involved', 'players', 'U')	('case', 'high', 'U')	
The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF, Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo.@#%^&*('left', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For Mr. Sherwin, a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count.@#%^&*('carry', 'ROOT', 'R')	
GAF faces potential fines of $500,000 for each count.@#%^&*('faces', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Individuals familiar with the case said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that throughout September, defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort@#%^&*('attorneys', 'prevent', 'U')	('talking', 'said', 'U')	('to', 'prevent', 'U')	
to prevent a trial,@#%^&*('prevent', 'talking', 'U')	
but by the end of the month the talks had ended.@#%^&*('ended', 'said', 'U')	
There is much speculation among attorneys@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
not involved@#%^&*('involved', 'attorneys', 'U')	
that the strategy of GAF's attorney, Arthur Liman, and Mr. Sherwin's counsel, Stephen Kaufman, will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman.@#%^&*('include', 'is', 'U')	
Neither testified at the previous trials.@#%^&*('testified', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For now, defense attorneys are tight-lipped about their plans.@#%^&*('tight', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Max Gitter, another GAF defense attorney, said yesterday,@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"As we go in for the third time,@#%^&*('go', 'hope', 'U')	('in', 'apt', 'U')	
Yogi Berra's famous line is apt:@#%^&*('apt', 'go', 'U')	
`It's deja vu all over again. '"@#%^&*('vu', 'apt', 'U')	
DALKON SHIELD CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal.@#%^&*('hope', 'said', 'U')	
Attorneys for more than 18,000 women@#%^&*('Attorneys', 'asked', 'U')	('women', 'claim', 'U')

representing 18,136 claimants in the U.S. and abroad@#%^&*('representing', 'attorneys', 'U')	('abroad', 'argue', 'U')

that the appeal would delay@#%^&*('appeal', 'destroy', 'U')	('delay', 'argue', 'U')	
-- and perhaps even destroy --@#%^&*('destroy', 'argue', 'U')	('destroy', 'delay', 'U')	('a', 'fund', 'U')	
a $2.38 billion settlement fund@#%^&*('fund', 'argue', 'U')	('fund', 'delay', 'U')	('fund', 'delay', 'U')	('fund', 'centerpiece', 'U')	
that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan.@#%^&*('centerpiece', 'fund', 'U')	
The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants@#%^&*('challenged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because it places a cap on the total amount of money available@#%^&*('places', 'challenged', 'U')	('cap', 'settle', 'U')	('to', 'settle', 'U')	
to settle claims.@#%^&*('settle', 'available', 'U')	
It also bars future suits against Robins company officials, members of the Robins family and Robins's former insurer, Aetna Life & Casualty Co.@#%^&*('bars', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The latter provision is "legally unprecedented,"@#%^&*('unprecedented', 'said', 'U')	
said Alan B. Morrison, a public interest lawyer in Washington, D.C.,@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Morrison', 'challenging', 'U')	('is', 'challenging', 'U')	
who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants.@#%^&*('challenging', 'Morrison', 'U')	
More than 100,000 claims against Robins are pending.@#%^&*('pending', 'ROOT', 'R')

In a brief@#%^&*('brief', 'criticizes', 'U')	
filed with the Supreme Court last week,@#%^&*('filed', 'brief', 'U')	
Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal@#%^&*('criticizes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
for raising "abstract" and "theoretical" legal issues,@#%^&*('raising', 'appeal', 'U')	
while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants.@#%^&*('jeopardizing', 'criticizes', 'U')	
The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3@#%^&*('Court', 'issue', 'U')	('scheduled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6.@#%^&*('issue', 'scheduled', 'U')	
JURY`S CRIMINAL CONVICTION under Superfund law is a first.@#%^&*('first', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Charles A. Donohoo, sole proprieter of a Louisville, Ky., demolition company, was found guilty of violating the Superfund law as well as the Clean Air Act.@#%^&*('found', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare,@#%^&*('rare', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'decision', 'U')	
and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case.@#%^&*('verdict', 'rare', 'U')	
Under Superfund, those@#%^&*('Superfund', 'liable', 'U')	('those', 'owned', 'U')	('those', 'generated', 'U')	('those', 'transported', 'U')	('those', 'liable', 'U')	
who owned, generated or transported hazardous waste@#%^&*('owned', 'those', 'U')	('generated', 'those', 'U')	('transported', 'those', 'U')	
are liable for its cleanup,@#%^&*('liable', 'ROOT', 'R')	
regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time.@#%^&*('legal', 'liable', 'U')	
Environmental lawyers say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties@#%^&*('involved', 'say', 'U')	
designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities.@#%^&*('designed', 'penalties', 'U')	
But Superfund also contains a criminal provision@#%^&*('contains', 'ROOT', 'R')	
concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment.@#%^&*('release', 'provision', 'U')	
In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty@#%^&*('strengthened', 'ROOT', 'R')	
by making it a felony.@#%^&*('making', 'strengthened', 'U')	
Mr. Donohoo was convicted in Louisville late last month of violating Superfund@#%^&*('convicted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building@#%^&*('failing', 'violating', 'U')	('he', 'demolishing', 'U')	
he was demolishing.@#%^&*('demolishing', 'building', 'U')	
He was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building, a violation of the Clean Air Act.@#%^&*('convicted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The government sought a criminal penalty@#%^&*('sought', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because "no cleanup is possible here.@#%^&*('possible', 'sought', 'U')	
Once {asbestos} is released into the environment,@#%^&*('released', 'lodge', 'U')

Yet another political scandal is racking Japan.@#%^&*RB	DT	JJ	NN	VBZ	VBG	NNP	.	
But this time it's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party members.@#%^&*CC	DT	NN	PRP	VBZ	VBG	NN	RB	RB	IN	NN	NNS	.	
And@#%^&*CC	
as it unfolds,@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBZ	,	
it's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society.@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	VBG	DT	IN	DT	RBR	JJ	CC	JJR	NNS	IN	JJ	NN	.	
Already, ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands@#%^&*RB	,	VBG	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNS	
that opposition members testify under oath in parliament@#%^&*IN	NN	NNS	VBP	IN	NN	IN	NN	
have stalled one budget committee session@#%^&*VBP	VBN	CD	NN	NN	NN	
and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month.@#%^&*CC	VBD	DT	NN	TO	VB	DT	JJ	JJ	NN	IN	DT	NN	IN	DT	NN	.	
But the scandal itself is so convoluted@#%^&*CC	DT	NN	PRP	VBZ	RB	JJ	
that ruling-party members are divided between those@#%^&*IN	NN	NNS	VBP	VBN	IN	DT	
who want to pursue the matter in hope@#%^&*WP	VBP	TO	VB	DT	NN	IN	NN	
of undermining the opposition@#%^&*IN	VBG	DT	NN	
and those@#%^&*CC	DT	
who favor leaving well enough alone.@#%^&*WP	VBP	VBG	RB	RB	RB	.	
"The opposition can be the most hurt@#%^&*``	DT	NN	MD	VB	DT	JJS	NN	
because everyone already figures@#%^&*IN	NN	RB	VBZ	
the LDP is that kind of beast,"@#%^&*DT	NNP	VBZ	DT	NN	IN	NN	,	''	
says Shigezo Hayasaka, former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst.@#%^&*VBZ	NNP	NNP	,	JJ	NN	TO	NNP	NN	NNP	NNP	CC	RB	DT	JJ	NN	.	
But,@#%^&*CC	,	
he adds,@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	,	
"We can't tell@#%^&*``	PRP	MD	RB	VB	
where it will go at all@#%^&*WRB	PRP	MD	VB	IN	DT	
because we're still in the middle of it."@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBP	RB	IN	DT	NN	IN	PRP	.	''	
This time, the scandal centers on donations@#%^&*DT	NN	,	DT	NN	VBZ	IN	NNS	
made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry.@#%^&*VBN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	NN	NN	.	
Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling.@#%^&*NN	,	DT	NN	IN	NN	,	VBZ	NNP	POS	JJ	NN	IN	JJ	NN	.	
The donations so far appear to be small,@#%^&*DT	NNS	RB	RB	VBP	TO	VB	JJ	,	
especially compared with the huge sums@#%^&*RB	VBN	IN	DT	JJ	NNS	
that changed hands in the Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal@#%^&*WDT	VBD	NNS	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	NN	NN	
that plagued the ruling party last year.@#%^&*WDT	VBD	DT	NN	NN	JJ	NN	.	
But the implications could be great.@#%^&*CC	DT	NNS	MD	VB	JJ	.	
Pachinko is slightly on the shady side,@#%^&*NN	VBZ	RB	IN	DT	JJ	NN	,	
often linked to the lower ranks of Japan's underworld@#%^&*RB	VBN	TO	DT	JJR	NNS	IN	NNP	POS	NN	
and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders.@#%^&*CC	RB	IN	DT	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	IN	NN	NNS	.	
Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions,@#%^&*RB	DT	NN	VBZ	VBN	DT	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	,	
and political donations may have been made with the intent@#%^&*CC	JJ	NNS	MD	VB	VBN	VBN	IN	DT	NN	
to bribe.@#%^&*TO	VB	.	
Also, about 60% of pachinko parlor owners are Korean,@#%^&*RB	,	RB	CD	NN	IN	NN	NN	NNS	VBP	NNP	,	
many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents' organizations,@#%^&*JJ	IN	WP	VBP	JJ	NNS	IN	NNP	CC	NNP	NNP	NNS	POS	NNS	,	
and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan.@#%^&*CC	NNS	IN	JJ	JJ	NNS	VBP	JJ	IN	NNP	.	
To many Japanese, pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory.@#%^&*TO	JJ	NNS	,	NN	VBZ	JJ	CC	RB	JJ	.	
Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country.@#%^&*JJ	NN	NN	NNS	VBP	IN	DT	JJ	NNS	CC	JJ	NNS	IN	NNS	CC	NNS	IN	DT	NN	.	
Devotees pass hours,@#%^&*NNS	VBP	NNS	,	
watching the lights blink@#%^&*VBG	DT	NNS	VBP	
and listening to the metal balls ping,@#%^&*CC	VBG	TO	DT	NN	NNS	NN	,	
as much to gamble@#%^&*RB	JJ	TO	VB	
as to get a little time@#%^&*IN	TO	VB	DT	JJ	NN	
to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts.@#%^&*TO	VB	JJ	,	RB	IN	PRP$	NNS	.	
At 500 yen@#%^&*IN	CD	NNS	
($3.60)@#%^&*RB	$	CD	CD	
for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime,@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	IN	NNS	,	NN	VBZ	DT	JJ	NN	,	
and has been@#%^&*CC	VBZ	VBN	
since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II.@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBD	NN	IN	JJ	NN	IN	DT	NNS	IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	.	
But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen@#%^&*CC	DT	NN	IN	PDT	DT	VBG	NNS	VBZ	VBN	DT	NN	IN	DT	JJ	JJ	NN	IN	CD	CD	NNS	
(almost $92 billion),@#%^&*RB	RB	$	CD	CD	CD	,	
or nearly the size of Japan's vaunted automobile industry.@#%^&*CC	RB	DT	NN	IN	NNP	POS	JJ	NN	NN	.	
And@#%^&*CC	
because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion,@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	NN	VBZ	RB	IN	DT	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	IN	NN	NN	,	
some observers estimate@#%^&*DT	NNS	VBP	
the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen.@#%^&*DT	JJ	NN	MD	VB	RB	JJ	IN	CD	CD	NNS	.	
If that money were being taxed,@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	VBD	VBG	VBN	,	
it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen.@#%^&*PRP	MD	VB	DT	NN	DT	RB	VBN	JJ	CD	NNS	.	
In 1984, an attempt was made@#%^&*IN	CD	,	DT	NN	VBD	VBN	
to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions.@#%^&*TO	VB	RP	IN	DT	NN	IN	JJR	NNS	.	
Then, in 1988, a proposal@#%^&*RB	,	IN	CD	,	DT	NN	
to keep better track of income@#%^&*TO	VB	JJR	NN	IN	NN	
by selling prepaid cards for pachinko@#%^&*IN	VBG	JJ	NNS	IN	NN	
was fielded in parliament.@#%^&*VBD	VBN	IN	NN	.	
The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin:@#%^&*DT	NN	VBD	DT	NN	IN	CD	,	IN	DT	NNS	IN	JJ	NN	:	
North Koreans oppose the plan@#%^&*NNP	NNPS	VBP	DT	NN	
while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it@#%^&*IN	NNP	NNPS	,	NNPS	CC	NNPS	VBP	PRP	
or are neutral.@#%^&*CC	VBP	JJ	.	
In August, a conservative weekly magazine reported@#%^&*IN	NNP	,	DT	JJ	JJ	NN	VBD	
that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members.@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	NN	NN	VBD	NN	TO	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNS	.	
The magazine alleged@#%^&*DT	NN	VBD	
that@#%^&*IN	
in making the donations,@#%^&*IN	VBG	DT	NNS	,	
the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes@#%^&*DT	NN	NN	MD	VB	VBN	VBG	NNS	
to win support in the battle against prepaid cards,@#%^&*TO	VB	NN	IN	DT	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	,	
or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren.@#%^&*CC	PRP	MD	VB	VBN	VBG	NN	RB	CC	RB	IN	DT	NNP	CC	DT	NNP	NNP	NNS	POS	NN	,	DT	NNP	NNP	.	
The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report.@#%^&*DT	NNP	NNP	CC	DT	NNP	RB	VBD	DT	NN	.	
And at first, neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue.@#%^&*CC	IN	JJ	,	CC	DT	NN	CC	DT	NNP	VBD	TO	VB	DT	NN	.	
But the press kept it alive;@#%^&*CC	DT	NN	VBD	PRP	JJ	:	
as with the Recruit scandal, lists began circulating with names of people@#%^&*IN	IN	DT	NNP	NN	,	NNS	VBD	VBG	IN	NNS	IN	NNS	
who had received money.@#%^&*WP	VBD	VBN	NN	.	
Within a matter of weeks, less-conservative magazines reported@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	IN	NNS	,	JJ	NNS	VBD	
that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations.@#%^&*IN	NNS	IN	DT	NN	NNP	VBD	VBN	RB	JJR	NNS	IN	NN	NNS	.	
So far, though, there have been no allegations@#%^&*RB	RB	,	RB	,	EX	VBP	VBN	DT	NNS	
that the contributions@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	
the LDP members received@#%^&*DT	NNP	NNS	VBD	
amounted to bribes.@#%^&*VBD	TO	NNS	.	
Then the two camps upped the ante:@#%^&*RB	DT	CD	NNS	VBD	DT	NN	:	
Reports@#%^&*NNS	
that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members@#%^&*IN	NNP	NNP	VBD	VBN	RB	TO	NNP	NNS	
were rapidly countered by statements@#%^&*VBD	RB	VBN	IN	NNS	
that the South Korean residents' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members.@#%^&*IN	DT	JJ	JJ	NNS	POS	NN	VBD	RB	VBN	VBG	RB	TO	NNP	NNS	.	
The JSP admitted Oct. 13@#%^&*DT	NNP	VBD	NNP	CD	
that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization,@#%^&*IN	PRP$	NNS	VBD	RB	CD	CD	NN	IN	DT	NN	NN	,	
and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen@#%^&*CC	VBD	NNP	NNS	IN	VBG	CD	CD	NN	
($880,000)@#%^&*RB	$	CD	CD	
and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen.@#%^&*CC	JJ	NN	NNS	IN	VBG	RB	CD	CD	NN	.	
On Friday, the chief cabinet secretary announced@#%^&*IN	NNP	,	DT	JJ	NN	NN	VBD	
that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry,@#%^&*IN	CD	NN	NNS	VBD	VBN	CD	CD	NN	IN	DT	NN	,	
including 450,000 yen@#%^&*VBG	CD	NNS	
($3,175)@#%^&*RB	$	CD	CD	
by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.@#%^&*IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	.	
No one has alleged@#%^&*DT	NN	VBZ	VBN	
that the donations were by themselves illegal.@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	VBD	IN	PRP	JJ	.	
Direct donations from either of the residents' organizations would be illegal@#%^&*JJ	NNS	IN	DT	IN	DT	NNS	POS	NNS	MD	VB	JJ	
because the groups are defined as foreign,@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	VBP	VBN	IN	JJ	,	
but both groups deny making direct donations.@#%^&*CC	DT	NNS	VBP	VBG	JJ	NNS	.	
They say@#%^&*PRP	VBP	
its possible some of their members may be donating privately.@#%^&*PRP$	JJ	DT	IN	PRP$	NNS	MD	VB	VBG	RB	.	
The issue is further complicated@#%^&*DT	NN	VBZ	RB	VBN	
because@#%^&*IN	
although the organizations represent Korean residents,@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	VBP	JJ	NNS	,	
those residents were largely born and raised in Japan@#%^&*DT	NNS	VBD	RB	VBN	CC	VBN	IN	NNP	
and many speak only Japanese.@#%^&*CC	JJ	VBP	RB	JJ	.	
That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBP	JJ	NN	CC	NNS	VBZ	DT	NN	IN	NN	
-- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades@#%^&*:	PRP$	NNS	VBD	VBN	IN	IN	NNS	IN	DT	NNS	
when Japan occupied Korea before World War II --@#%^&*WRB	NNP	VBD	NNP	IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	:	
and the discrimination@#%^&*CC	DT	NN	
that still faces Koreans in Japanese society.@#%^&*IN	RB	VBZ	NNPS	IN	JJ	NN	.	
Many Japanese think it only natural@#%^&*JJ	NNPS	VBP	PRP	RB	JJ	
that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians, the way@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	CC	PRP$	NNS	MD	VB	TO	NNS	,	DT	NN	
many Japanese do,@#%^&*JJ	NNS	VBP	,	
to win favor or support.@#%^&*TO	VB	NN	CC	NN	.	
Both residents' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad.@#%^&*DT	NNS	POS	NNS	VBP	TO	VBG	DT	NN	IN	RB	.	
But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP's alleged donations,@#%^&*CC	NNP	NNS	CC	NNS	IN	DT	JJ	NN	NN	VBP	TO	VB	IN	NN	IN	DT	NNP	POS	JJ	NNS	,	
implying@#%^&*VBG	
that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean@#%^&*IN	NNP	NNP	NN	MD	VB	RBR	JJ	IN	NNP	NNP	
because North Korea is communist@#%^&*IN	NNP	NNP	VBZ	JJ

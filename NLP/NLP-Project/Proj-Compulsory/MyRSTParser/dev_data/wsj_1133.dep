President Bush is considering casting a line-item veto as a test@#%^&*('considering', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'determine', 'U')	
to determine@#%^&*('determine', 'test', 'U')

Mr. Bush has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment@#%^&*('campaigned', 'ROOT', 'R')	('amendment', 'give', 'U')	
that would explicitly give him a line-item veto,@#%^&*('give', 'amendment', 'U')	('veto', 'enable', 'U')	('would', 'enable', 'U')	
which would enable him to kill individual items in a big spending bill@#%^&*('enable', 'veto', 'U')	
without having to kill the entire bill.@#%^&*
He has argued@#%^&*('argued', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that such presidential power is necessary@#%^&*('power', 'rein', 'U')	('necessary', 'argued', 'U')	
to rein in congressional spending.@#%^&*('rein', 'necessary', 'U')	
But some analysts, particularly conservative legal scholars, have urged Mr. Bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert@#%^&*('urged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the Constitution already implicitly gives him the power@#%^&*('gives', 'assert', 'U')

Mr. Bush is "interested" in finding a suitable test case.@#%^&*('interested', 'said', 'U')	
But he also said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that exercising a test line-item veto isn't a "top initiative" on the president's agenda@#%^&*('initiative', 'said', 'U')	
because he faces more-pressing budget issues at the moment.@#%^&*('faces', 'initiative', 'U')

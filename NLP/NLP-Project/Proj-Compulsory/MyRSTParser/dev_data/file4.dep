The government is sharpening its newest weapon against white-collar defendants :@#%^&*('sharpening', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the power@#%^&*('power', 'weapon', 'U')	
to prevent them from paying their legal bills.@#%^&*('prevent', 'power', 'U')	
And defense lawyers are warning@#%^&*('warning', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that they won't stick around@#%^&*('stick', 'warning', 'U')	
if they don't get paid.@#%^&*('paid', 'stick', 'U')	
The issue has come to a boil in Newark, N.J.,@#%^&*('come', 'ROOT', 'R')	
where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for Eddie Antar@#%^&*('warned', 'come', 'U')	
that@#%^&*('that', 'move', 'U')	
if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted,@#%^&*('indicted', 'move', 'U')	('the', 'government', 'U')	
the government may move to seize the money@#%^&*('move', 'warned', 'U')	
that Mr. Antar is using to pay legal fees.@#%^&*('using', 'seize', 'U')	
The warning by the U.S. attorney's office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June.@#%^&*('follows', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In those cases, the high court ruled@#%^&*('ruled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority@#%^&*('gives', 'ruled', 'U')	('to', 'seize', 'U')	
to seize assets of people@#%^&*('seize', 'authority', 'U')	
accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes,@#%^&*('accused', 'people', 'U')	
including fees@#%^&*('fees', 'accused', 'U')	
paid to lawyers before an indictment.@#%^&*('paid', 'fees', 'U')	
If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. Antar's assets,@#%^&*('succeeds', 'left', 'U')	('he', 'left', 'U')	
he could be left without top-flight legal representation,@#%^&*('left', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because his attorneys are likely to quit,@#%^&*('likely', 'left', 'U')	('to', 'left', 'U')	
according to individuals familiar with the case.@#%^&*('individuals', 'left', 'U')	
A seizure also would make the case the largest@#%^&*('make', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- and one of the first --@#%^&*('one', 'make', 'U')	('one', 'largest', 'U')	
in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution@#%^&*('confiscated', 'make', 'U')	('confiscated', 'largest', 'U')	
unrelated to drugs.@#%^&*('unrelated', 'prosecution', 'U')	
"The people@#%^&*('people', 'suffer', 'U')	('people', 'defendants', 'U')	
who suffer in the short run@#%^&*('suffer', 'people', 'U')	
are defendants,@#%^&*('defendants', 'says', 'U')	
but the people@#%^&*('people', 'suffer', 'U')	('people', 'all', 'U')	
who suffer in the long run@#%^&*('suffer', 'people', 'U')	
are all of the people,@#%^&*('all', 'defendants', 'U')	('all', 'says', 'U')	
because there won't be a vigorous private bar@#%^&*('bar', 'all', 'U')	
to defend the Bill of Rights,"@#%^&*('defend', 'bar', 'U')	
says Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense attorney@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
who says@#%^&*('he', 'turned', 'U')	
he has turned down a number of cases@#%^&*('turned', 'says', 'U')	
to avoid possible fee seizures.@#%^&*('avoid', 'turned', 'U')	
Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark,@#%^&*('investigated', 'ROOT', 'R')	
where prosecutors have told him@#%^&*('told', 'investigated', 'U')	
that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges.@#%^&*('seek', 'told', 'U')	
Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, the government has the authority@#%^&*('has', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to seek to freeze or seize a defendant's assets before trial.@#%^&*('seek', 'authority', 'U')	
According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar's case,@#%^&*('to', 'issued', 'U')	('individuals', 'issued', 'U')	
prosecutors issued their warning this week@#%^&*('issued', 'ROOT', 'R')	
after one of Mr. Antar's attorneys asked@#%^&*('asked', 'issued', 'U')	
whether legal fees might be subject to seizure.@#%^&*('subject', 'asked', 'U')	
In a letter, prosecutors told Mr. Antar's lawyers@#%^&*('told', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that@#%^&*('that', 'expect', 'U')	
because of the recent Supreme Court rulings,@#%^&*('because', 'expect', 'U')	('rulings', 'expect', 'U')	
they could expect@#%^&*('expect', 'told', 'U')	('expect', 'told', 'U')	
that any fees@#%^&*('that', 'seized', 'U')	('fees', 'seized', 'U')	
collected from Mr. Antar@#%^&*('collected', 'fees', 'U')	
may be seized.@#%^&*('seized', 'expect', 'U')	
Prosecutors have told Mr. Antar's attorneys@#%^&*('told', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that they believe@#%^&*('believe', 'told', 'U')	
Mr. Antar's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great@#%^&*('great', 'believe', 'U')	
that any money@#%^&*('that', 'derives', 'U')	('money', 'derives', 'U')	
he has used@#%^&*('he', 'pay', 'U')	('used', 'money', 'U')	
to pay attorneys@#%^&*('pay', 'used', 'U')	
derives from illegal activities.@#%^&*('derives', 'great', 'U')	
Therefore,@#%^&*('Therefore', 'taken', 'U')	
they said,@#%^&*('said', 'taken', 'U')	('the', 'money', 'U')	
the money can be taken from the lawyers@#%^&*('taken', 'ROOT', 'R')	
even after they are paid.@#%^&*('paid', 'taken', 'U')	
Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault, attorneys for Mr. Antar, both declined to comment on the matter.@#%^&*('declined', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In Newark, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said,@#%^&*('Newark', 'think', 'U')	('said', 'think', 'U')	('I', 'think', 'U')	
"I don't think@#%^&*('think', 'ROOT', 'R')	
there's any legal reason@#%^&*("'s", 'think', 'U')	
to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases."@#%^&*('limit', 'reason', 'U')	
Mr. Alito said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
his office "just responded to an attorney's question@#%^&*('responded', 'said', 'U')	
about whether we would go after attorney's fees,@#%^&*('go', 'responded', 'U')	
and that is different from actually doing it,@#%^&*('different', 'responded', 'U')	('different', 'go', 'U')	
although we reserve that right."@#%^&*('reserve', 'different', 'U')	
Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit@#%^&*('charged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission.@#%^&*('filed', 'suit', 'U')	
In that suit, the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a "massive financial fraud"@#%^&*('accused', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie, Edison, N.J., over a three-year period.@#%^&*('overstate', 'engaging', 'U')	
Through his lawyers, Mr. Antar has denied allegations in the SEC suit and in civil suits@#%^&*('denied', 'ROOT', 'R')	
previously filed by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others.@#%^&*('filed', 'suits', 'U')	
The SEC has alleged@#%^&*('alleged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements@#%^&*('aimed', 'alleged', 'U')	('in', 'sell', 'U')	
in order to sell his stake@#%^&*('sell', 'pump', 'U')	
and reap huge profits.@#%^&*('reap', 'pump', 'U')	('reap', 'sell', 'U')	
Mr. Antar,@#%^&*('Antar', 'made', 'U')	
the SEC said,@#%^&*('said', 'made', 'U')	
made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987.@#%^&*('made', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Justice Department has emphasized@#%^&*('emphasized', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the government's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly.@#%^&*('is', 'emphasized', 'U')	
According to department policy,@#%^&*('to', 'make', 'U')	('policy', 'make', 'U')	
prosecutors must make a strong showing@#%^&*('make', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that lawyers ' fees came from assets@#%^&*('came', 'make', 'U')	
tainted by illegal profits@#%^&*('tainted', 'assets', 'U')	
before any attempts at seizure are made.@#%^&*('made', 'tainted', 'U')	
Still, criminal defense lawyers worry@#%^&*('worry', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial@#%^&*('deprived', 'worry', 'U')	
if the government can seize lawyers ' fees.@#%^&*('seize', 'deprived', 'U')	
They also worry@#%^&*('worry', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that@#%^&*('that', 'unwilling', 'U')	
if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly,@#%^&*('applies', 'unwilling', 'U')	('the', 'lawyers', 'U')	
the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases@#%^&*('unwilling', 'worry', 'U')	
unless they are assured of being paid.@#%^&*('assured', 'take', 'U')

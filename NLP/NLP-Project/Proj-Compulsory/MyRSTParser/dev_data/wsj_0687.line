Dennis Farney's Oct. 13 page-one article "River of Despair," about the poverty along the Mississippi, fanned childhood memories@#%^&*1
of when my parents were sharecroppers in southeastern Arkansas, only a few miles from the river.@#%^&*1
Although we were white,@#%^&*2
the same economic factors affected us@#%^&*2
as affects the black people@#%^&*2
Mr. Farney writes about.@#%^&*2
Fortunately, an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm@#%^&*3
and moved us 50 miles north to good schools and an environment@#%^&*3
that opened the world of opportunity for me as an eight-year-old.@#%^&*3
Though I've been blessed with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world,@#%^&*4
I've never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of the 1930s.@#%^&*4
Most of the land in that and other parts of the Delta are now owned by second, third or fourth generations of the same families.@#%^&*5
These are the families@#%^&*6
who used@#%^&*6
-- and sometime abused@#%^&*6
-- their sharecroppers, people@#%^&*6
who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life.@#%^&*6
Following World War II,@#%^&*7
when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops@#%^&*7
formerly requiring 20 families,@#%^&*7
the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no Social Security, no skills in the workplace, no hope for their future except welfare.@#%^&*7
And today, many of their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren remain on welfare.@#%^&*8
In the meantime, the landowners continue receiving generous subsidies@#%^&*9
that began during New Deal days.@#%^&*9
Or those@#%^&*10
who choose not to farm@#%^&*10
can lease their lands and crop allotments for handsome sums.@#%^&*10
Farmers in the Midwest and other areas have suffered,@#%^&*11
but those along the Mississippi continue to prosper with holdings@#%^&*11
that were built with the sweat of men and women@#%^&*11
living in economic slavery.@#%^&*11
And when they were no longer needed,@#%^&*12
they were turned loose@#%^&*12
unprepared to build lives of their own.@#%^&*12

Because the cycle of poverty along the lower Mississippi goes back so many generations,@#%^&*13
breaking this cycle will be next to impossible.@#%^&*13
Sadly, the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral.@#%^&*14
Yet the evidence@#%^&*15
that we have not hit bottom@#%^&*15
is found in the fact@#%^&*15
that we are not yet helping ourselves.@#%^&*15
The people of the Delta are waiting for that big factory to open, river traffic to increase, government spending to fund job-training programs or public schools to educate apathetic students.@#%^&*16
Because we refuse to face the tough answers,@#%^&*17
the questions continue as fodder for the commissions and committees, for the media and politicians.@#%^&*17
Coffee-shop chatter does not lend itself to solving the problems of racism, teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance.@#%^&*18
Does the Delta deserve government help@#%^&*19
in attracting industry@#%^&*19
when the majority of residents, black and white, do not realize@#%^&*19
racism alienates potential employers?@#%^&*19
Should we focus on the region's infant-mortality rate@#%^&*19
when the vocal right-wingers and the school boards, mayors and legislators prohibit schools from teaching the two ways@#%^&*19
(abstinence or contraceptives)@#%^&*19
of decreasing teen pregnancy?@#%^&*19
Delta problems are difficult, not impossible, to solve@#%^&*19
-- I am just not convinced@#%^&*19
that we are ready to solve them yet.@#%^&*19

I would like to issue a challenge to corporate America.@#%^&*21
The next time expansion plans are mentioned at the old company@#%^&*22
and somebody says,@#%^&*22
"Aw heck, guys, nobody can do it like Japan or South Korea,"@#%^&*22
I wish you@#%^&*22
would butt in@#%^&*22
and say,@#%^&*22
"Hold it, fellas,@#%^&*22
why don't we compare prices@#%^&*22
and use our own little Third World country.@#%^&*22
We would even save on freight."@#%^&*23
There is no mystery@#%^&*24
why the Delta originated "Singin' the Blues."@#%^&*24

Your story is an insult to the citizens of the Mississippi Delta.@#%^&*26
Many of the problems@#%^&*27
you presented@#%^&*27
exist in every part of this country.@#%^&*27
Poverty is only two blocks from President Bush's residence.@#%^&*28
For years, we tried to ignore the problem of poverty,@#%^&*29
and@#%^&*29
now that it has gotten out of hand@#%^&*29
it's a new crusade for the media and our Democratic Congress.@#%^&*29
Nobody should have to live in such poor conditions as in "Sugar Ditch,"@#%^&*30
but@#%^&*30
when you travel to Washington, Boston, Chicago or New York,@#%^&*30
the same problems exist.@#%^&*30
The only difference is, in those cities the poor are housed in high-rise-project apartments@#%^&*31
each consisting of one room, with rusty pipes@#%^&*31
called plumbing,@#%^&*31
rodents and cockroaches everywhere and nonworking elevators@#%^&*31
-- and with the building patrolled by gangs and drug dealers.@#%^&*31
Many middle-class people would love free food, Medicaid insurance, utilities and rent.@#%^&*32
Then maybe I could stay home@#%^&*33
and have seven children@#%^&*33
and watch Oprah Winfrey, like Beulah in the article,@#%^&*33
instead of having one child@#%^&*33
and working constantly@#%^&*33
just to stay above water, like so many families in this country.@#%^&*33

Pension funds, insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said@#%^&*1
they began scooping up stocks during Friday's market rout.@#%^&*1
And they plan to buy more today.@#%^&*2
Rightly or wrongly, many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war@#%^&*3
by applying the lesson@#%^&*3
they learned in the October 1987 crash:@#%^&*3
Buying at the bottom pays off.@#%^&*3
To be sure,@#%^&*4
big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry@#%^&*4
if stocks open sharply lower today.@#%^&*4
They could still panic@#%^&*5
and bail out of the market.@#%^&*5
But their 1987 performance indicates@#%^&*6
that they won't abandon stocks@#%^&*6
unless conditions get far worse.@#%^&*6
"Last time, we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks@#%^&*7
when the panic was the worst,"@#%^&*7
said John W. Rogers, president of Chicago-based Ariel Capital Management Inc.,@#%^&*7
which manages $1.1 billion of stocks.@#%^&*7
Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for "our favorite stocks@#%^&*8
that have fallen apart."@#%^&*8
He expects to invest the rest@#%^&*9
if the market weakens further.@#%^&*9
Denver-based portfolio manager James Craig wasn't daunted@#%^&*10
when Friday's rout shaved $40 million from the value of the $752 million Janus Fund@#%^&*10
he oversees.@#%^&*10
"I waited@#%^&*11
to make sure@#%^&*11
all the program trades had kicked through,"@#%^&*11
he said.@#%^&*11
Then he jumped into the market:@#%^&*12
"I spent $30 million in the last half-hour."@#%^&*12
Other money managers also opened their wallets.@#%^&*13
"I was buying at the close@#%^&*14
(Friday)@#%^&*14
and I'll be buying again@#%^&*14
because I know we're getting good value,"@#%^&*14
said Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., Greenwich, Conn.@#%^&*14
"There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash."@#%^&*15
Unlike mutual funds,@#%^&*16
which can be forced to sell stockholdings@#%^&*16
when investors rush to withdraw money,@#%^&*16
big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms@#%^&*16
without jettisoning stock.@#%^&*16
Most often, they do just that,@#%^&*17
because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment,@#%^&*17
attracting about $1 trillion from pension funds alone.@#%^&*17
"If you bought after the crash,@#%^&*18
you did very very well off the bottom,"@#%^&*18
said Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc.@#%^&*18
The $56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System, for one, added $1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago.@#%^&*19
"The last crash taught institutional investors@#%^&*20
that they have to be long-term holders,@#%^&*20
and that they can't react to short-term events, good or bad,"@#%^&*20
said Stephen L. Nesbitt, senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica, Calif.@#%^&*20
"Those@#%^&*21
that pulled out@#%^&*21
(of stocks)@#%^&*21
regretted it,"@#%^&*21
he said,@#%^&*21
"so I doubt@#%^&*21
you'll see any significant changes" in institutional portfolios@#%^&*21
as a result of Friday's decline.@#%^&*21
Stocks,@#%^&*22
as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index,@#%^&*22
have been stellar performers this year,@#%^&*22
rising 27.97% before Friday's plunge,@#%^&*22
excluding dividends.@#%^&*22
Even Friday's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20%, well above the annual average for stocks over several decades.@#%^&*23
"You could go down 400 points@#%^&*24
and still have a good year in the market,"@#%^&*24
said James D. Awad, president of New York-based BMI Capital Corp.@#%^&*24
Mr. Awad, however, worries@#%^&*25
that the market "could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days.@#%^&*25
It can happen@#%^&*26
before you can turn around."@#%^&*26
He said@#%^&*27
he discerns many parallels with 1987,@#%^&*27
including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading.@#%^&*27
"The only thing you don't have,"@#%^&*28
he said,@#%^&*28
"is the `portfolio insurance' phenomenon@#%^&*28
overlaid on the rest."@#%^&*28
Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique,@#%^&*29
which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash.@#%^&*29
Not really insurance, this tactic was designed@#%^&*30
to soften the blow of declining stock prices@#%^&*30
and generate an offsetting profit@#%^&*30
by selling waves of S&P futures contracts.@#%^&*30
In its severest test, the $60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash didn't work,@#%^&*31
as stock buyers disappeared@#%^&*31
and stock and futures prices became disconnected.@#%^&*31
Even without portfolio insurance,@#%^&*32
market conditions were grim Friday,@#%^&*32
money managers said.@#%^&*32
Neil Weisman,@#%^&*33
whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85% of its $220 million investment pool to cash in recent months,@#%^&*33
said@#%^&*33
he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday@#%^&*33
asking him to take stock off their hands.@#%^&*33
"We got calls from big block houses@#%^&*34
asking us@#%^&*34
if we want to make bids on anything,"@#%^&*34
said Mr. Weisman,@#%^&*34
who, happy with his returns on investments@#%^&*34
chalked up earlier,@#%^&*34
declined the offers.@#%^&*34
Mr. Weisman predicts@#%^&*35
stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days@#%^&*35
before declining again,@#%^&*35
trapping more investors.@#%^&*35
"I think@#%^&*36
it will be a rigor mortis rally,"@#%^&*36
he said.@#%^&*36
Meanwhile, Friday brought a reprieve for money managers@#%^&*37
whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally.@#%^&*37
Especially gleeful were the short sellers,@#%^&*38
who have been pounded by this year's market climb.@#%^&*38
The shorts sell borrowed shares,@#%^&*39
hoping to profit@#%^&*39
by replacing them later at a lower price.@#%^&*39
The nation's largest short-selling operation is Feshbach Brothers, Palo Alto, Calif.,@#%^&*40
which said last May@#%^&*40
that its short positions had shown losses of 10% for the year up to that point.@#%^&*40
All that now has changed.@#%^&*41
"We're ahead for the year@#%^&*42
because of Friday,"@#%^&*42
said the firm's Kurt Feshbach.@#%^&*42
"We're not making a killing,@#%^&*43
but we had a good day."@#%^&*43

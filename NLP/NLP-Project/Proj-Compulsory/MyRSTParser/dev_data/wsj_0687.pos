Dennis Farney's Oct. 13 page-one article "River of Despair," about the poverty along the Mississippi, fanned childhood memories@#%^&*NNP	NNP	POS	NNP	CD	NN	NN	``	NN	IN	NN	,	''	IN	DT	NN	IN	DT	NNP	,	VBD	NN	NNS

Fortunately, an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm@#%^&*RB	,	DT	NN	IN	DT	NN	NN	VBD	DT	JJ	NN

Most of the land in that and other parts of the Delta are now owned by second, third or fourth generations of the same families.@#%^&*JJS	IN	DT	NN	IN	DT	CC	JJ	NNS	IN	DT	NNP	VBP	RB	VBN	IN	JJ	,	JJ	CC	JJ	NNS	IN	DT	JJ	NNS	.

Following World War II,@#%^&*VBG	NNP	NNP	NNP	,	
when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops@#%^&*WRB	CD	NN	IN	JJ	NN	MD	VB	NNS	
formerly requiring 20 families,@#%^&*RB	VBG	CD	NNS	,	
the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no Social Security, no skills in the workplace, no hope for their future except welfare.@#%^&*DT	NN	NNS	VBD	VBN	IN	DT	NN	IN	NN	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	,	DT	NNS	IN	DT	NN	,	DT	NN	IN	PRP$	NN	IN	NN	.

In the meantime, the landowners continue receiving generous subsidies@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	,	DT	NNS	VBP	VBG	JJ	NNS

Yet the evidence@#%^&*CC	DT	NN

that we are not yet helping ourselves.@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBP	RB	RB	VBG	PRP	.

The government is sharpening its newest weapon against white-collar defendants :@#%^&*1
the power@#%^&*1
to prevent them from paying their legal bills.@#%^&*1
And defense lawyers are warning@#%^&*2
that they won't stick around@#%^&*2
if they don't get paid.@#%^&*2
The issue has come to a boil in Newark, N.J.,@#%^&*3
where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for Eddie Antar@#%^&*3
that@#%^&*3
if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted,@#%^&*3
the government may move to seize the money@#%^&*3
that Mr. Antar is using to pay legal fees.@#%^&*3
The warning by the U.S. attorney's office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June.@#%^&*4
In those cases, the high court ruled@#%^&*5
that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority@#%^&*5
to seize assets of people@#%^&*5
accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes,@#%^&*5
including fees@#%^&*5
paid to lawyers before an indictment.@#%^&*5
If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. Antar's assets,@#%^&*6
he could be left without top-flight legal representation,@#%^&*6
because his attorneys are likely to quit,@#%^&*6
according to individuals familiar with the case.@#%^&*6
A seizure also would make the case the largest@#%^&*7
-- and one of the first --@#%^&*7
in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution@#%^&*7
unrelated to drugs.@#%^&*7
"The people@#%^&*8
who suffer in the short run@#%^&*8
are defendants,@#%^&*8
but the people@#%^&*8
who suffer in the long run@#%^&*8
are all of the people,@#%^&*8
because there won't be a vigorous private bar@#%^&*8
to defend the Bill of Rights,"@#%^&*8
says Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense attorney@#%^&*8
who says@#%^&*8
he has turned down a number of cases@#%^&*8
to avoid possible fee seizures.@#%^&*8
Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark,@#%^&*9
where prosecutors have told him@#%^&*9
that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges.@#%^&*9
Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, the government has the authority@#%^&*10
to seek to freeze or seize a defendant's assets before trial.@#%^&*10
According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar's case,@#%^&*11
prosecutors issued their warning this week@#%^&*11
after one of Mr. Antar's attorneys asked@#%^&*11
whether legal fees might be subject to seizure.@#%^&*11
In a letter, prosecutors told Mr. Antar's lawyers@#%^&*12
that@#%^&*12
because of the recent Supreme Court rulings,@#%^&*12
they could expect@#%^&*12
that any fees@#%^&*12
collected from Mr. Antar@#%^&*12
may be seized.@#%^&*12
Prosecutors have told Mr. Antar's attorneys@#%^&*13
that they believe@#%^&*13
Mr. Antar's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great@#%^&*13
that any money@#%^&*13
he has used@#%^&*13
to pay attorneys@#%^&*13
derives from illegal activities.@#%^&*13
Therefore,@#%^&*14
they said,@#%^&*14
the money can be taken from the lawyers@#%^&*14
even after they are paid.@#%^&*14
Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault, attorneys for Mr. Antar, both declined to comment on the matter.@#%^&*15
In Newark, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said,@#%^&*16
"I don't think@#%^&*16
there's any legal reason@#%^&*16
to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases."@#%^&*16
Mr. Alito said@#%^&*17
his office "just responded to an attorney's question@#%^&*17
about whether we would go after attorney's fees,@#%^&*17
and that is different from actually doing it,@#%^&*17
although we reserve that right."@#%^&*17
Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit@#%^&*18
filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission.@#%^&*18
In that suit, the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a "massive financial fraud"@#%^&*19
to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie, Edison, N.J., over a three-year period.@#%^&*19
Through his lawyers, Mr. Antar has denied allegations in the SEC suit and in civil suits@#%^&*20
previously filed by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others.@#%^&*20
The SEC has alleged@#%^&*21
that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements@#%^&*21
in order to sell his stake@#%^&*21
and reap huge profits.@#%^&*21
Mr. Antar,@#%^&*22
the SEC said,@#%^&*22
made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987.@#%^&*22
The Justice Department has emphasized@#%^&*23
that the government's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly.@#%^&*23
According to department policy,@#%^&*24
prosecutors must make a strong showing@#%^&*24
that lawyers ' fees came from assets@#%^&*24
tainted by illegal profits@#%^&*24
before any attempts at seizure are made.@#%^&*24
Still, criminal defense lawyers worry@#%^&*25
that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial@#%^&*25
if the government can seize lawyers ' fees.@#%^&*25
They also worry@#%^&*26
that@#%^&*26
if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly,@#%^&*26
the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases@#%^&*26
unless they are assured of being paid.@#%^&*26

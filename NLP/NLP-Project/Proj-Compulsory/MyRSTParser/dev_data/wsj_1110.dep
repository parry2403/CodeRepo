New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September@#%^&*('fell', 'reported', 'U')	
after shooting up the month before,@#%^&*('shooting', 'fell', 'U')	
reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models,@#%^&*('reflecting', 'fell', 'U')	
the Commerce Department reported.@#%^&*('reported', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Orders for military equipment, household appliances, machinery and other goods@#%^&*('Orders', 'dipped', 'U')	
expected to last at least three years@#%^&*('expected', 'Orders', 'U')	
dipped 0.1% last month, to $126.68 billion,@#%^&*('dipped', 'said', 'U')	
after leaping 3.9% in August,@#%^&*('leaping', 'dipped', 'U')	
the department said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in August.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Moreover, a recent government report@#%^&*('Moreover', 'contributed', 'U')	('report', 'contributed', 'U')	
showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing@#%^&*('showing', 'report', 'U')	
had contributed to perceptions@#%^&*('contributed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl.@#%^&*('slowed', 'contributed', 'U')	
But many economists pointed to a 1.8% September rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category.@#%^&*('pointed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That "suggests@#%^&*('suggests', 'said', 'U')	
the manufacturing sector is not falling apart,"@#%^&*('falling', 'suggests', 'U')	
said Sally Kleinman, an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
She added, however:@#%^&*('added', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"It is not robust by any means."@#%^&*('robust', 'added', 'U')	
While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total,@#%^&*('pulled', 'propped', 'U')	('an', 'jump', 'U')	
an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up.@#%^&*('propped', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56%,@#%^&*('skyrocketed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'analyst', 'U')	
and a government analyst said@#%^&*('said', 'skyrocketed', 'U')	
nearly all areas saw increases,@#%^&*('saw', 'said', 'U')	
including airplanes, missiles, ships, tanks and communications equipment.@#%^&*('airplanes', 'increases', 'U')	('missiles', 'increases', 'U')	('ships', 'increases', 'U')	('tanks', 'increases', 'U')	('communications', 'increases', 'U')	
Orders for military goods usually catapult in September,@#%^&*('catapult', 'ROOT', 'R')	
government officials say,@#%^&*('say', 'catapult', 'U')	
as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money@#%^&*('scrambles', 'catapult', 'U')	
before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.@#%^&*('begins', 'spend', 'U')	
While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations,@#%^&*('adjusted', 'said', 'U')	('a', 'analyst', 'U')	
a Commerce Department analyst said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the adjustment probably didn't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders.@#%^&*('factor', 'said', 'U')	
Without the increase in defense bookings,@#%^&*('increase', 'plummeted', 'U')	
September orders would have plummeted 3.9%.@#%^&*('plummeted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Analysts were most unsettled by evidence@#%^&*('unsettled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the backlog of orders at factories is slipping.@#%^&*('slipping', 'evidence', 'U')	
Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4% in September, to $476.14 billion,@#%^&*('rose', 'ROOT', 'R')	
after declining for the first time in 2 1/2 years in August.@#%^&*('declining', 'rose', 'U')	
after declining for the first time in 2 1/2 years in August.@#%^&*
In July unfilled orders grew 1%.@#%^&*('grew', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But analysts noted@#%^&*('noted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that@#%^&*('that', 'declined', 'U')	
excluding transportation-@#%^&*('transportation', 'believe', 'U')	('transportation', 'declined', 'U')	
where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures-@#%^&*('surge', 'transportation', 'U')	
order backlogs have declined for three months in a row.@#%^&*('declined', 'noted', 'U')	
"It means we're eating into the bread@#%^&*('means', 'ROOT', 'R')	('bread', 'keeps', 'U')	
that keeps us going.@#%^&*('keeps', 'bread', 'U')	
That is a little disturbing,"@#%^&*('disturbing', 'said', 'U')	
Ms. Kleinman said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"It also means@#%^&*('means', 'fall', 'U')	
if you have a real drop-off in orders,@#%^&*('have', 'means', 'U')	
production will likely fall off very quickly@#%^&*('fall', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because there is less@#%^&*('is', 'quickly', 'U')	
to keep things going."@#%^&*('keep', 'is', 'U')	
Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row,@#%^&*('tumbled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
posting a 5.6% drop after a 10.3% decline.@#%^&*('posting', 'tumbled', 'U')	
Such steep drops in a category@#%^&*('drops', 'news', 'U')	
seen as a barometer of business investment@#%^&*('seen', 'category', 'U')	
would customarily be grave news for the economy.@#%^&*('news', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But a Commerce Department analyst said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that in both months orders would have risen@#%^&*('risen', 'said', 'U')	
had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings, a category@#%^&*('been', 'risen', 'U')	('category', 'showing', 'U')	
that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year.@#%^&*('showing', 'category', 'U')	
Still, Milton Hudson, senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York, said:@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"If you look back a half-year or so@#%^&*('look', 'good', 'U')	
the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector.@#%^&*('good', 'said', 'U')	
Now at least there are question marks about that,@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and without any question the pace of growth has slowed."@#%^&*('slowed', 'are', 'U')

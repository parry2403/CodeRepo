With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening,@#%^&*IN	JJ	NN	IN	DT	NNP	CC	NNP	NN	,	
many Japanese had feared last week's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.@#%^&*JJ	NNP	VBD	VBN	JJ	NN	POS	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	.	
They expected a new barrage of demands@#%^&*PRP	VBD	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NNS	
that Japan do something quickly@#%^&*IN	NNP	VBP	NN	RB	
to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S.@#%^&*TO	VB	PRP$	NN	NN	IN	DT	NNP	.	
Instead, they got a discussion of the need@#%^&*RB	,	PRP	VBD	DT	NN	IN	DT	NN	
for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view.@#%^&*IN	DT	NNP	CC	NNP	TO	VB	RB	CC	IN	DT	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	.	
Mrs. Hills' first trip to Japan as America's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	POS	JJ	NN	TO	NNP	IN	NNP	POS	JJ	NN	NN	VBD	DT	RB	JJ	NN	IN	JJ	NN	POS	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	.	
Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	IN	JJ	NNS	IN	JJ	NN	IN	NNS	IN	JJ	JJ	NN	NNS	
that supposedly inhibit free trade.@#%^&*IN	RB	VBP	JJ	NN	.	
He said@#%^&*PRP	VBD	
such results should be "measurable in dollars and cents"@#%^&*JJ	NNS	MD	VB	``	JJ	IN	NNS	CC	NNS	''	
in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.@#%^&*IN	VBG	DT	NNP	NN	NN	IN	NNP	.	
But Mrs. Hills,@#%^&*CC	NNP	NNP	,	
speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday,@#%^&*VBG	IN	DT	NN	NN	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	IN	NNP	IN	NNP	IN	NNP	,	
stressed@#%^&*VBN	
that the objective "is not to get definitive action by spring or summer,@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	``	VBZ	RB	TO	VB	JJ	NN	IN	NN	CC	NN	,	
it is rather to have a blueprint for action."@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	RB	TO	VB	DT	NN	IN	NN	.	''	
She added@#%^&*PRP	VBD	
that she expected "perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBD	``	RB	TO	VB	DT	JJ	NN	.	.	.	DT	JJ	NN	
to convince the American people and the Japanese people@#%^&*TO	VB	DT	JJ	NNS	CC	DT	JJ	NNS	
that we're moving in earnest."@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBP	VBG	IN	NN	.	''	
How such remarks translate into policy won't become clear for months.@#%^&*WRB	JJ	NNS	VBP	IN	NN	MD	RB	VB	JJ	IN	NNS	.	
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills.@#%^&*JJ	CC	JJ	NNS	VBD	JJ	NNS	IN	DT	NN	IN	NN	NN	NNP	NNP	CC	NNP	NNP	.	
Many called it simply a contrast in styles.@#%^&*JJ	VBD	PRP	RB	DT	NN	IN	NNS	.	
But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic.@#%^&*CC	DT	VBD	PRP	IN	DT	JJ	NN	NN	.	
Others said@#%^&*NNS	VBD	
the Bush administration may feel@#%^&*DT	NNP	NN	MD	VB	
the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand.@#%^&*DT	NN	IN	DT	NNS	VBZ	VBG	IN	IN	NN	.	
And some said@#%^&*CC	DT	VBD	
it reflected the growing debate in Washington@#%^&*PRP	VBD	DT	VBG	NN	IN	NNP	
over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade.@#%^&*IN	VBG	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	CC	DT	NN	IN	VBN	NN	.	
Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher's,@#%^&*VBN	TO	VB	PRP$	NN	TO	NNP	NNP	POS	,	
Mrs. Hills replied:@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	:	
"I didn't hear every word@#%^&*``	PRP	VBD	RB	VB	DT	NN	
he spoke,@#%^&*PRP	VBD	,	
but as a general proposition,@#%^&*CC	IN	DT	JJ	NN	,	
I think@#%^&*PRP	VBP	
we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration."@#%^&*PRP	VBP	DT	RB	JJ	NN	NN	IN	DT	NNP	NN	.	''	
Yet more than one American official@#%^&*RB	JJR	IN	CD	JJ	NN	
who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials@#%^&*WP	VBD	RP	IN	PRP	IN	CD	NNS	IN	NNS	IN	JJ	NNS

"I think@#%^&*``	PRP	VBP

Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	IN	DT	NN	NN	NNP	NN	.	
"I am painted sometimes as ferocious,@#%^&*``	PRP	VBP	VBN	RB	IN	JJ	,	
perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes@#%^&*RB	IN	PRP	VBP	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NNS

of opening markets and expanding trade."@#%^&*IN	VBG	NNS	CC	VBG	NN	.	''	
When she met the local press for the first time on Friday,@#%^&*WRB	PRP	VBD	DT	JJ	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	,	
Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress@#%^&*NNP	NNP	RB	VBD	DT	NN	IN	NN	
in removing barriers to trade in forest products, satellites and supercomputers, three areas@#%^&*IN	VBG	NNS	TO	VB	IN	NN	NNS	,	NNS	CC	NNS	,	CD	NNS	
targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill.@#%^&*VBN	IN	DT	NNP	CD	NN	IN	DT	CD	NN	NN	.	
She highlighted exclusionary business practices@#%^&*PRP	VBD	JJ	NN	NNS	
that the U.S. government has identified.@#%^&*IN	DT	NNP	NN	VBZ	VBN	.	
But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition.@#%^&*CC	PRP$	JJ	NN	VBD	TO	VB	DT	NN	IN	JJ	JJ	NN	CC	JJ	NN	.	
She said@#%^&*PRP	VBD	
the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors@#%^&*DT	NN	NN	VBD	RB	JJ	TO	JJ	NNS	
and shouldn't be tackled@#%^&*CC	MD	RB	VB	VBN	
by setting quantitative targets.@#%^&*IN	VBG	JJ	NNS	.	
At her news conference for Japanese reporters, one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief.@#%^&*IN	PRP$	NN	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	,	CD	NN	NN	VBD	RP	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NN	.	
"My impression was that you would be a scary old lady,"@#%^&*``	PRP$	NN	VBD	IN	PRP	MD	VB	DT	JJ	JJ	NN	,	''	
he said,@#%^&*PRP	VBD	,	
drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues.@#%^&*VBG	DT	JJ	JJ	VBZ	IN	PRP$	NNS	.	
"But I am relieved to see@#%^&*``	CC	PRP	VBP	JJ	TO	VB	
that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity."@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBP	JJ	CC	JJ	CC	JJ	CC	DT	NN	IN	NN	.	''	
Mrs. Hills' remarks did raise questions, at least among some U.S. officials,@#%^&*NNP	NNP	POS	NNS	VBD	VB	NNS	,	IN	JJS	IN	DT	NNP	NNS	,	
about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market.@#%^&*IN	WP	RB	PRP$	NN	VBZ	IN	NNP	NN	TO	DT	JJ	NN	NN	.	
The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10% for years.@#%^&*DT	NNP	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	VBZ	VBN	VBN	IN	CD	NN	IN	NNS	.	
Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement@#%^&*JJ	NNPS	VBP	VBN	DT	CD	NN	
as assuring U.S. companies a 20% share by 1991,@#%^&*IN	VBG	NNP	NNS	DT	CD	NN	NN	IN	CD	,	
but the Japanese have denied making any such promise.@#%^&*CC	DT	NNPS	VBP	VBN	VBG	DT	JJ	NN	.	
At one of her news conferences, Mrs. Hills said,@#%^&*IN	CD	IN	PRP$	NN	NNS	,	NNP	NNP	VBD	,	
"I believe@#%^&*``	PRP	VBP	
we can do much better than 20%."@#%^&*PRP	MD	VB	RB	JJR	IN	CD	NN	.	''	
But she stressed,@#%^&*CC	PRP	VBD	,	
"I am against managed trade.@#%^&*``	PRP	VBP	IN	VBN	NN	.

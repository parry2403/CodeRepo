The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy@#%^&*('has', 'ROOT', 'R')	
(on Arthur Avenue)@#%^&*('Avenue', 'Italy', 'U')	
and, of course, the Yankees.@#%^&*('course', 'Italy', 'U')	('Yankees', 'garden', 'U')	('Yankees', 'Italy', 'U')	
However, most people,@#%^&*('However', 'look', 'U')	('people', 'look', 'U')	
having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx,@#%^&*('subjected', 'look', 'U')	
look at the borough the way@#%^&*('look', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy did in "Bonfire of the Vanities"@#%^&*('did', 'look', 'U')	('a', 'turn', 'U')	
-- as a wrong turn into hell.@#%^&*('turn', 'Bonfire', 'U')	('hell', 'did', 'U')	
But Laura Cunningham's Bronx, her childhood Bronx of the '50s, is something else altogether.@#%^&*('something', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In a lovely, novelistic memoir, "Sleeping Arrangements"@#%^&*('memoir', 'remembers', 'U')	
(Knopf, 195 pages, $18.95),@#%^&*('Knopf', 'memoir', 'U')	
she remembers an exotic playground,@#%^&*('remembers', 'ROOT', 'R')	
peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic@#%^&*('peopled', 'playground', 'U')	
(real oddballs like her sexpot friend, the hell-kitten Diana, age five).@#%^&*('oddballs', 'Catholic', 'U')	
Ms. Cunningham, a novelist and playwright, has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall.@#%^&*('has', 'ROOT', 'R')	
She transforms her "Bronx of the emotions, a place@#%^&*('transforms', 'ROOT', 'R')	('her', 'relieved', 'U')	('Bronx', 'relieved', 'U')	
where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria"@#%^&*('relieved', 'transforms', 'U')	('the', 'Bronx', 'U')	
into the "Babylonian Bronx," a world@#%^&*('Bronx', 'relieved', 'U')	('world', 'relieved', 'U')	
simmering with sex and death and intrigue.@#%^&*('simmering', 'world', 'U')	('intrigue', 'relieved', 'U')	('intrigue', 'Bronx', 'U')	
In the Babylonian Bronx, Jewish working-class people lived in drab, Soviet-style buildings@#%^&*('lived', 'ROOT', 'R')	('buildings', 'lobbies', 'U')	
"glamorized" with names like AnaMor Towers@#%^&*('glamorized', 'buildings', 'U')	
(after owners Anna and Morris Snezak),@#%^&*('Snezak', 'Towers', 'U')	
whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks, friezes of Pompeii.@#%^&*('decorated', 'buildings', 'U')	
For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy@#%^&*('matched', 'ROOT', 'R')	
she felt@#%^&*('felt', 'discrepancy', 'U')	
living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl: "@#%^&*('living', 'owing', 'U')	
. . . outwardly ordinary, inwardly ornate,@#%^&*('ordinary', 'owing', 'U')	
owing all inspiration to heathen cultures."@#%^&*('owing', 'felt', 'U')	
Sharp-witted and funny but never mean, she's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote,@#%^&*('mean', 'ROOT', 'R')	
if he'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy.@#%^&*('Jewish', 'mean', 'U')	('female', 'mean', 'U')	('bitchy', 'mean', 'U')	
Little Lily,@#%^&*('Lily', 'ordinary', 'U')	
as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book,@#%^&*('calls', 'Lily', 'U')	
really wasn't ordinary.@#%^&*('ordinary', 'ROOT', 'R')	
She was raised, for the first eight years, by her mother, Rosie,@#%^&*('raised', 'ROOT', 'R')	('mother', 'remembers', 'U')	
whom she remembers as a loving liar,@#%^&*('remembers', 'mother', 'U')	('liar', 'realigned', 'U')	
who realigned history@#%^&*('realigned', 'liar', 'U')	('to', 'explain', 'U')	
to explain@#%^&*('explain', 'realigned', 'U')	
why Lily's father didn't live with them.@#%^&*('live', 'explain', 'U')	
Rosie reinvented this man,@#%^&*('reinvented', 'ROOT', 'R')	('man', 'known', 'U')	
who may or may not have known about his child,@#%^&*('may', 'man', 'U')	('known', 'man', 'U')	('a', 'hero', 'U')	
as a war hero for Lily's benefit.@#%^&*('hero', 'reinvented', 'U')	
Rosie died young@#%^&*('died', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure,@#%^&*('remembered', 'died', 'U')	('figure', 'interfere', 'U')	
who didn't interfere much with her child's education on the streets.@#%^&*('interfere', 'figure', 'U')	
The games@#%^&*('games', 'played', 'U')	
Bronx children played@#%^&*('played', 'ROOT', 'R')	
(holding kids down@#%^&*('holding', 'played', 'U')	('holding', 'seem', 'U')	
and stripping them, for example)@#%^&*('stripping', 'played', 'U')	('stripping', 'holding', 'U')	('stripping', 'seem', 'U')	
seem tame by today's crack standards,@#%^&*('seem', 'played', 'U')	
but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure.@#%^&*('makes', 'played', 'U')	
"Without official knowledge of sex or death,@#%^&*('knowledge', 'flirted', 'U')	
we flirted with both,"@#%^&*('flirted', 'writes', 'U')	
she writes.@#%^&*('writes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements.@#%^&*('analyzed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Her friend Susan,@#%^&*('Susan', 'parents', 'U')	('Susan', 'slept', 'U')	
whose parents kept reminding her@#%^&*('kept', 'Susan', 'U')	
she was unwanted,@#%^&*('unwanted', 'reminding', 'U')	
slept on a narrow bed@#%^&*('slept', 'ROOT', 'R')	
wedged into her parents' bedroom,@#%^&*
as though she were a temporary visitor.@#%^&*('visitor', 'slept', 'U')	
Her friend Diana's father was a professional thief;@#%^&*('thief', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they didn't seem to have any bedrooms at all.@#%^&*('seem', 'thief', 'U')	
Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how@#%^&*('became', 'ROOT', 'R')	('people', 'kept', 'U')	('how', 'kept', 'U')	('her', 'arrangements', 'U')	
because her own arrangements kept shifting.@#%^&*('arrangements', 'how', 'U')	('kept', 'obsessed', 'U')	('kept', 'slept', 'U')	
When Rosie died,@#%^&*('died', 'moved', 'U')	
her uncles moved in@#%^&*('uncles', 'let', 'U')	('moved', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements.@#%^&*('let', 'moved', 'U')	
They painted the apartment orange, pink and white,@#%^&*('painted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
according to her instructions.@#%^&*('to', 'painted', 'U')	('instructions', 'painted', 'U')	
With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe, an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist@#%^&*('recalls', 'ROOT', 'R')	
(who rhymed river with liver in a love song);@#%^&*('rhymed', 'recalls', 'U')	
and Uncle Len, a mysterious part-time investigator@#%^&*('Len', 'like', 'U')	('investigator', 'looked', 'U')	('investigator', 'carried', 'U')	
who looked like Lincoln@#%^&*('looked', 'investigator', 'U')	
and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope, like an "undercover President on a good-will mission."@#%^&*('carried', 'investigator', 'U')	('carried', 'looked', 'U')	('like', 'recalls', 'U')	
They came by their strangeness honestly.@#%^&*('came', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Lily's grandmother, no cookie baker, excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album,@#%^&*('grandmother', 'lugged', 'U')	('excised', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress, "Philosophy for Women."@#%^&*('lugged', 'excised', 'U')	
The book loses some momentum toward the end,@#%^&*('loses', 'ROOT', 'R')	('end', 'becomes', 'U')	
when Lily becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family.@#%^&*('becomes', 'end', 'U')	
For the most part, though, there's much pleasure in her saucy, poignant probe into the mysteries of the Babylonian Bronx.@#%^&*("'s", 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Bronx also figures in Bruce Jay Friedman's latest novel,@#%^&*('figures', 'ROOT', 'R')	('novel', 'flashes', 'U')	
which flashes back to the New York of the '50s.@#%^&*('flashes', 'novel', 'U')	
But both the past and present worlds of "The Current Climate"@#%^&*('But', 'feel', 'U')	('past', 'feel', 'U')	('worlds', 'feel', 'U')	
(Atlantic Monthly Press, 200 pages, $18.95)@#%^&*('Press', 'Climate', 'U')	
feel cramped and static.@#%^&*('feel', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For his sixth novel, Mr. Friedman tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his 1972 work, "About Harry Towns."@#%^&*('tried', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Harry is now a 57-year-old writer,@#%^&*('writer', 'ROOT', 'R')	('writer', 'flirtation', 'U')	
whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out-of-synch.@#%^&*('seems', 'writer', 'U')	
Harry fondly remembers the "old" days of the early '70s,@#%^&*('remembers', 'explains', 'U')	("'70s", 'take', 'U')	
when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date@#%^&*('take', "'70s", 'U')	
to analyze what Travis was doing wrong. "An L.A. solution," explains Mr. Friedman.@#%^&*('analyze', 'date', 'U')	('explains', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Line by line Mr. Friedman's weary cynicism can be amusing,@#%^&*('amusing', 'ROOT', 'R')	
especially when he's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme@#%^&*('riffing', 'amusing', 'U')	('the', 'people', 'U')	
-- the way@#%^&*('way', 'people', 'U')	
people size each other up,@#%^&*('size', 'amusing', 'U')	
immediately canceling the desperate ones@#%^&*('canceling', 'size', 'U')	('ones', 'made', 'U')	
who merely almost made it.@#%^&*('made', 'ones', 'U')	
Harry has avoided all that@#%^&*('avoided', 'ROOT', 'R')	
by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife,@#%^&*('living', 'avoided', 'U')	('wife', 'addicted', 'U')	
who's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels@#%^&*('addicted', 'wife', 'U')	
she barely seems to notice@#%^&*('seems', 'operas', 'U')	
when her husband disappears for drug-seeking forays into Manhattan.@#%^&*('disappears', 'notice', 'U')	
But it doesn't take too many lines@#%^&*('take', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'figure', 'U')	
to figure Harry out.@#%^&*('figure', 'take', 'U')	
He's a bore.@#%^&*('bore', 'ROOT', 'R')

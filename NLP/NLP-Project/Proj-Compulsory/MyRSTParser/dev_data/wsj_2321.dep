With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening,@#%^&*('tension', 'feared', 'U')	
many Japanese had feared last week's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.@#%^&*('feared', 'ROOT', 'R')	
They expected a new barrage of demands@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Japan do something quickly@#%^&*('do', 'expected', 'U')	('quickly', 'reduce', 'U')	
to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S.@#%^&*('reduce', 'do', 'U')	
Instead, they got a discussion of the need@#%^&*('got', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'U.S.', 'U')	
for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view.@#%^&*('U.S.', 'need', 'U')	('Japan', 'need', 'U')	('work', 'got', 'U')	
Mrs. Hills' first trip to Japan as America's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices@#%^&*('called', 'ROOT', 'R')	('practices', 'inhibit', 'U')	
that supposedly inhibit free trade.@#%^&*('inhibit', 'practices', 'U')	
He said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
such results should be "measurable in dollars and cents"@#%^&*('measurable', 'said', 'U')	
in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.@#%^&*('reducing', 'measurable', 'U')	
But Mrs. Hills,@#%^&*('But', 'stressed', 'U')	('Hills', 'stressed', 'U')	
speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday,@#%^&*('speaking', 'Hills', 'U')	
stressed@#%^&*('stressed', 'rather', 'U')	
that the objective "is not to get definitive action by spring or summer,@#%^&*('is', 'stressed', 'U')	('it', 'rather', 'U')	('it', 'have', 'U')	('is', 'rather', 'U')	
it is rather to have a blueprint for action."@#%^&*('rather', 'ROOT', 'R')	
She added@#%^&*('added', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that she expected "perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step@#%^&*('expected', 'added', 'U')	('to', 'convince', 'U')	
to convince the American people and the Japanese people@#%^&*('convince', 'step', 'U')	
that we're moving in earnest."@#%^&*('moving', 'convince', 'U')	
How such remarks translate into policy won't become clear for months.@#%^&*('become', 'ROOT', 'R')	
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills.@#%^&*('offered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Many called it simply a contrast in styles.@#%^&*('called', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic.@#%^&*('saw', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Others said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'administration', 'U')	
the Bush administration may feel@#%^&*('feel', 'said', 'U')	('the', 'rhetoric', 'U')	
the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand.@#%^&*('getting', 'feel', 'U')	
And some said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it reflected the growing debate in Washington@#%^&*('reflected', 'said', 'U')	
over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade.@#%^&*('pursuing', 'reflected', 'U')	
Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher's,@#%^&*('Asked', 'think', 'U')	
Mrs. Hills replied:@#%^&*('replied', 'compare', 'U')	
"I didn't hear every word@#%^&*('hear', 'replied', 'U')	('he', 'spoke', 'U')	
he spoke,@#%^&*('spoke', 'word', 'U')	
but as a general proposition,@#%^&*('proposition', 'compare', 'U')	
I think@#%^&*('think', 'ROOT', 'R')	
we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration."@#%^&*('have', 'think', 'U')	
Yet more than one American official@#%^&*('Yet', 'said', 'U')	('official', 'sat', 'U')	('official', 'said', 'U')	
who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials@#%^&*
said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
her tone often was surprisingly "conciliatory."@#%^&*('conciliatory', 'said', 'U')	
"I think@#%^&*('think', 'said', 'U')	
my line has been very consistent,"@#%^&*('consistent', 'think', 'U')	
Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"I am painted sometimes as ferocious,@#%^&*('painted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes@#%^&*('have', 'painted', 'U')	
to implement.@#%^&*('implement', 'statutes', 'U')	
I don't feel very ferocious.@#%^&*('feel', 'ROOT', 'R')	
I don't feel either hard or soft.@#%^&*('feel', 'ROOT', 'R')	
I feel committed to the program@#%^&*('feel', 'ROOT', 'R')	
of opening markets and expanding trade."@#%^&*('markets', 'program', 'U')	('trade', 'program', 'U')	
When she met the local press for the first time on Friday,@#%^&*('met', 'reiterated', 'U')	
Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress@#%^&*('reiterated', 'ROOT', 'R')	
in removing barriers to trade in forest products, satellites and supercomputers, three areas@#%^&*('removing', 'reiterated', 'U')	
targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill.@#%^&*('targeted', 'areas', 'U')	
She highlighted exclusionary business practices@#%^&*('highlighted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the U.S. government has identified.@#%^&*('identified', 'highlighted', 'U')	
But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition.@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	
She said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors@#%^&*('imbalance', 'tackled', 'U')	('due', 'said', 'U')	
and shouldn't be tackled@#%^&*('tackled', 'said', 'U')	('tackled', 'due', 'U')	
by setting quantitative targets.@#%^&*('setting', 'tackled', 'U')	
At her news conference for Japanese reporters, one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief.@#%^&*('summed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"My impression was that you would be a scary old lady,"@#%^&*('was', 'said', 'U')	
he said,@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues.@#%^&*('drawing', 'said', 'U')	
"But I am relieved to see@#%^&*('relieved', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity."@#%^&*('gentle', 'see', 'U')	('intelligent', 'see', 'U')	('person', 'see', 'U')	
Mrs. Hills' remarks did raise questions, at least among some U.S. officials,@#%^&*('did', 'ROOT', 'R')	
about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market.@#%^&*('is', 'officials', 'U')	
The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10% for years.@#%^&*('stuck', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement@#%^&*('interpreted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as assuring U.S. companies a 20% share by 1991,@#%^&*('assuring', 'interpreted', 'U')	
but the Japanese have denied making any such promise.@#%^&*('denied', 'interpreted', 'U')	
At one of her news conferences, Mrs. Hills said,@#%^&*('one', 'believe', 'U')	('said', 'believe', 'U')	
"I believe@#%^&*('believe', 'ROOT', 'R')	
we can do much better than 20%."@#%^&*('do', 'believe', 'U')	
But she stressed,@#%^&*('stressed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"I am against managed trade.@#%^&*('am', 'stressed', 'U')	
I will not enter into an agreement@#%^&*('enter', 'ROOT', 'R')	('agreement', 'stipulates', 'U')	
that stipulates to a percentage of the market."@#%^&*('stipulates', 'agreement', 'U')

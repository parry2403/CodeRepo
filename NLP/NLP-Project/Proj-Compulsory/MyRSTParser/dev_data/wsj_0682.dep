Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July's crash of a United Airlines flight in Iowa:@#%^&*('identified', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'flaw', 'U')	
a structural flaw@#%^&*('flaw', 'identified', 'U')	('flaw', 'developed', 'U')	
that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk.@#%^&*('developed', 'flaw', 'U')	
For several months, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have suspected@#%^&*('suspected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack@#%^&*('led', 'suspected', 'U')	('crack', 'caused', 'U')	
that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight.@#%^&*('caused', 'crack', 'U')	
The explosion sent shards of metal flying,@#%^&*('explosion', 'led', 'U')	('sent', 'ROOT', 'R')	
severing the DC-10's hydraulic or control systems,@#%^&*('severing', 'sent', 'U')	
and led to the crash@#%^&*('led', 'sent', 'U')	('crash', 'killed', 'U')	
that killed 112 people.@#%^&*('killed', 'crash', 'U')	
But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232's tail engine from a cornfield near the Sioux City Airport in Iowa.@#%^&*('confirm', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in Sioux City.@#%^&*('begin', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Among the issues@#%^&*('issues', 'examine', 'U')	('the', 'board', 'U')	
the board will examine@#%^&*('examine', 'ROOT', 'R')	
is whether United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks.@#%^&*('is', 'examine', 'U')	
The engine involved was a CF6-6@#%^&*('CF6', 'ROOT', 'R')	
made by General Electric Co.@#%^&*('made', 'CF6', 'U')	
Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate@#%^&*('indicate', 'said', 'U')	('that', 'occurred', 'U')	('a', 'flaw', 'U')	
that a flaw@#%^&*('flaw', 'occurred', 'U')	
-- known as "hard alpha" --@#%^&*('known', 'flaw', 'U')	
occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago.@#%^&*('occurred', 'indicate', 'U')	
He said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
there wasn't any way@#%^&*('was', 'said', 'U')	
to detect the flaw at that time,@#%^&*('detect', 'way', 'U')	('that', 'changed', 'U')	('the', 'process', 'U')	
and that the process has since been changed@#%^&*('process', 'decrease', 'U')	('changed', 'said', 'U')	('changed', 'was', 'U')	
to decrease the chance@#%^&*('decrease', 'changed', 'U')	
that such flaws would occur.@#%^&*('occur', 'decrease', 'U')	
The FAA already has ordered@#%^&*('ordered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that all 232 disks@#%^&*('that', 'made', 'U')	('disks', 'made', 'U')	
made by the old process@#%^&*('made', 'ordered', 'U')	
be removed from the planes@#%^&*('removed', 'made', 'U')	
and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water-submersion chamber.@#%^&*('subjected', 'made', 'U')	('subjected', 'removed', 'U')	
Such tests make the FAA confident that a Sioux City-type accident "won't happen again,"@#%^&*('make', 'said', 'U')	
said Mr. Broderick.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A spokesman for GE said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the company has been working with the FAA all along on this issue@#%^&*('company', 'comply', 'U')	('working', 'said', 'U')	
and "will comply fully with the required inspections."@#%^&*('comply', 'said', 'U')	('comply', 'working', 'U')	
But he also pointed out@#%^&*('pointed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the recalls will have no impact on GE's engine production.@#%^&*('have', 'pointed', 'U')	
The CF6-6 series engines aren't being manufactured any more;@#%^&*('manufactured', 'said', 'U')	
they are only being used in the DC-10 Series 10 planes currently in service,@#%^&*('used', 'manufactured', 'U')	('he', 'said', 'U')	
he said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')

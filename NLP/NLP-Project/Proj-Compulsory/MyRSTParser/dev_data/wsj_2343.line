The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy@#%^&*1
(on Arthur Avenue)@#%^&*1
and, of course, the Yankees.@#%^&*1
However, most people,@#%^&*2
having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx,@#%^&*2
look at the borough the way@#%^&*2
Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy did in "Bonfire of the Vanities"@#%^&*2
-- as a wrong turn into hell.@#%^&*2
But Laura Cunningham's Bronx, her childhood Bronx of the '50s, is something else altogether.@#%^&*3
In a lovely, novelistic memoir, "Sleeping Arrangements"@#%^&*4
(Knopf, 195 pages, $18.95),@#%^&*4
she remembers an exotic playground,@#%^&*4
peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic@#%^&*4
(real oddballs like her sexpot friend, the hell-kitten Diana, age five).@#%^&*4
Ms. Cunningham, a novelist and playwright, has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall.@#%^&*5
She transforms her "Bronx of the emotions, a place@#%^&*6
where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria"@#%^&*6
into the "Babylonian Bronx," a world@#%^&*6
simmering with sex and death and intrigue.@#%^&*6
In the Babylonian Bronx, Jewish working-class people lived in drab, Soviet-style buildings@#%^&*7
"glamorized" with names like AnaMor Towers@#%^&*7
(after owners Anna and Morris Snezak),@#%^&*7
whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks, friezes of Pompeii.@#%^&*7
For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy@#%^&*8
she felt@#%^&*8
living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl: "@#%^&*8
. . . outwardly ordinary, inwardly ornate,@#%^&*8
owing all inspiration to heathen cultures."@#%^&*8
Sharp-witted and funny but never mean, she's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote,@#%^&*9
if he'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy.@#%^&*9
Little Lily,@#%^&*10
as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book,@#%^&*10
really wasn't ordinary.@#%^&*10
She was raised, for the first eight years, by her mother, Rosie,@#%^&*11
whom she remembers as a loving liar,@#%^&*11
who realigned history@#%^&*11
to explain@#%^&*11
why Lily's father didn't live with them.@#%^&*11
Rosie reinvented this man,@#%^&*12
who may or may not have known about his child,@#%^&*12
as a war hero for Lily's benefit.@#%^&*12
Rosie died young@#%^&*13
and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure,@#%^&*13
who didn't interfere much with her child's education on the streets.@#%^&*13
The games@#%^&*14
Bronx children played@#%^&*14
(holding kids down@#%^&*14
and stripping them, for example)@#%^&*14
seem tame by today's crack standards,@#%^&*14
but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure.@#%^&*14
"Without official knowledge of sex or death,@#%^&*15
we flirted with both,"@#%^&*15
she writes.@#%^&*15
She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements.@#%^&*16
Her friend Susan,@#%^&*17
whose parents kept reminding her@#%^&*17
she was unwanted,@#%^&*17
slept on a narrow bed@#%^&*17
wedged into her parents' bedroom,@#%^&*17
as though she were a temporary visitor.@#%^&*17
Her friend Diana's father was a professional thief;@#%^&*18
they didn't seem to have any bedrooms at all.@#%^&*18
Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how@#%^&*19
because her own arrangements kept shifting.@#%^&*19
When Rosie died,@#%^&*20
her uncles moved in@#%^&*20
-- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements.@#%^&*20
They painted the apartment orange, pink and white,@#%^&*21
according to her instructions.@#%^&*21
With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe, an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist@#%^&*22
(who rhymed river with liver in a love song);@#%^&*22
and Uncle Len, a mysterious part-time investigator@#%^&*22
who looked like Lincoln@#%^&*22
and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope, like an "undercover President on a good-will mission."@#%^&*22
They came by their strangeness honestly.@#%^&*23
Lily's grandmother, no cookie baker, excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album,@#%^&*24
and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress, "Philosophy for Women."@#%^&*24
The book loses some momentum toward the end,@#%^&*25
when Lily becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family.@#%^&*25
For the most part, though, there's much pleasure in her saucy, poignant probe into the mysteries of the Babylonian Bronx.@#%^&*26
The Bronx also figures in Bruce Jay Friedman's latest novel,@#%^&*27
which flashes back to the New York of the '50s.@#%^&*27
But both the past and present worlds of "The Current Climate"@#%^&*28
(Atlantic Monthly Press, 200 pages, $18.95)@#%^&*28
feel cramped and static.@#%^&*28
For his sixth novel, Mr. Friedman tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his 1972 work, "About Harry Towns."@#%^&*29
Harry is now a 57-year-old writer,@#%^&*30
whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out-of-synch.@#%^&*30
Harry fondly remembers the "old" days of the early '70s,@#%^&*31
when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date@#%^&*31
to analyze what Travis was doing wrong. "An L.A. solution," explains Mr. Friedman.@#%^&*31
Line by line Mr. Friedman's weary cynicism can be amusing,@#%^&*32
especially when he's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme@#%^&*32
-- the way@#%^&*32
people size each other up,@#%^&*32
immediately canceling the desperate ones@#%^&*32
who merely almost made it.@#%^&*32
Harry has avoided all that@#%^&*33
by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife,@#%^&*33
who's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels@#%^&*33
she barely seems to notice@#%^&*33
when her husband disappears for drug-seeking forays into Manhattan.@#%^&*33
But it doesn't take too many lines@#%^&*34
to figure Harry out.@#%^&*34
He's a bore.@#%^&*35

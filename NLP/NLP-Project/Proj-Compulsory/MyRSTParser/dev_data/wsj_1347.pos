filed by Alaska in August against Exxon and six other oil companies.@#%^&*VBN	IN	NNP	IN	NNP	IN	NNP	CC	CD	JJ	NN	NNS	.

That suit and Exxon's countersuit were filed in a state court in Anchorage.@#%^&*DT	NN	CC	NNP	POS	NN	VBD	VBN	IN	DT	NN	NN	IN	NNP	.	
Neither suit lists specific dollar claims,@#%^&*DT	NN	VBZ	JJ	NN	NNS	,

The oil company claims@#%^&*DT	NN	NN	NNS	
that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil@#%^&*IN	JJ	NNS	VBD	NNP	IN	VBG	NN	IN	DT	RB	CD	CD	NNS	IN	NN

Craig Tillery, an Alaska assistant attorney general, said in an interview last night@#%^&*NNP	NNP	,	DT	NNP	NN	NN	NN	,	VBD	IN	DT	NN	JJ	NN	
that Exxon's accusations "are not new.@#%^&*IN	NNP	POS	NNS	``	VBP	RB	JJ	.

Exxon claims@#%^&*NN	NNS	
that use of dispersants,@#%^&*IN	NN	IN	NNS	,	
which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets,@#%^&*WDT	VBP	DT	NN	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	,

The oil company claims@#%^&*DT	NN	NN	NNS	
that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBD	NN	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	RB	TO	DT	NN

The state's opposition to the use of dispersants,@#%^&*DT	NN	POS	NN	TO	DT	NN	IN	NNS	,	
Exxon says,@#%^&*NNP	VBZ	,

Alaskan and Coast Guard officials say@#%^&*JJ	CC	NNP	NNP	NNS	VBP	
Exxon's charges aren't relevant@#%^&*NNP	POS	NNS	VBP	RB	JJ

British Aerospace PLC and France's Thomson-CSF S.A. said@#%^&*1
they are nearing an agreement@#%^&*1
to merge their guided-missile divisions,@#%^&*1
greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors.@#%^&*1
The 50-50 joint venture,@#%^&*2
which may be dubbed Eurodynamics,@#%^&*2
would have combined annual sales of at least #1.4 billion@#%^&*2
($2.17 billion)@#%^&*2
and would be among the world's largest missile makers.@#%^&*2
After two years of talks, plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced@#%^&*3
for the companies to seek French and British government clearance.@#%^&*3
The companies hope for a final agreement by year-end.@#%^&*4
The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies,@#%^&*5
and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting.@#%^&*5
In recent months, a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture.@#%^&*6
Already, British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system.@#%^&*7
Just last week they announced@#%^&*8
they may make a joint bid@#%^&*8
to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC, a smaller British defense contractor@#%^&*8
rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit.@#%^&*8
The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF@#%^&*9
-- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts --@#%^&*9
is stirring controversy in Western Europe's defense industry.@#%^&*9
Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals,@#%^&*10
including Matra S.A. in France and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC.@#%^&*10
But neither Matra nor GEC@#%^&*11
-- unrelated to Stamford, Conn.-based General Electric Co. --@#%^&*11
are sitting quietly by@#%^&*11
as their competitors join forces.@#%^&*11
Yesterday, a source close to GEC confirmed@#%^&*12
that his company may join the Ferranti fight, as part of a possible consortium@#%^&*12
that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF.@#%^&*12
Companies@#%^&*13
with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid@#%^&*13
include Matra, Britain's Dowty Group PLC, West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, and France's Dassault group.@#%^&*13
But it may be weeks@#%^&*14
before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid,@#%^&*14
the source indicated.@#%^&*14
GEC plans first to study Ferranti's financial accounts,@#%^&*15
which@#%^&*15
auditors recently said@#%^&*15
included #215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit, International Signal & Control Group,@#%^&*15
with which Ferranti merged last year.@#%^&*15
Also, any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators;@#%^&*16
Ferranti is GEC's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts,@#%^&*16
and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country's defense industry.@#%^&*16
A consortium bid, however, would diminish GEC's direct role in Ferranti@#%^&*17
and might consequently appease ministry officials.@#%^&*17
A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti:@#%^&*18
"Competition is the name of the game,"@#%^&*18
she said.@#%^&*18
At least one potential GEC partner, Matra, insists@#%^&*19
it isn't interested in Ferranti.@#%^&*19
"We have nothing to say about this affair,@#%^&*20
which doesn't concern us,"@#%^&*20
a Matra official said Sunday.@#%^&*20
The missile venture,@#%^&*21
the British Aerospace spokeswoman said,@#%^&*21
is a needed response to the "new environment" in defense contracting.@#%^&*21
For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries;@#%^&*22
and Middle East sales, a traditional mainstay for both companies' exports, have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices.@#%^&*22
The venture's importance for Thomson is great.@#%^&*23
Thomson feels@#%^&*24
the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans.@#%^&*24
The European defense industry is consolidating;@#%^&*25
for instance, West Germany's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain's Plessey Co.,@#%^&*25
and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b. H.@#%^&*25
In missiles, Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival, France's Aerospatiale S.A.;@#%^&*26
to better compete,@#%^&*26
Thomson officials say,@#%^&*26
they need a partnership.@#%^&*26
To justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture,@#%^&*27
Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace.@#%^&*27
Annual revenue of British Aerospace's missile business is about #950 million,@#%^&*28
a Thomson spokesman said.@#%^&*28
British Aerospace's chief missile products include its 17-year-old family of Rapier surface-to-air missiles.@#%^&*29
Thomson missile products, with about half British Aerospace's annual revenue, include the Crotale surface-to-air missile family.@#%^&*30

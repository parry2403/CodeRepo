New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September@#%^&*1
after shooting up the month before,@#%^&*1
reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models,@#%^&*1
the Commerce Department reported.@#%^&*1
Orders for military equipment, household appliances, machinery and other goods@#%^&*2
expected to last at least three years@#%^&*2
dipped 0.1% last month, to $126.68 billion,@#%^&*2
after leaping 3.9% in August,@#%^&*2
the department said.@#%^&*2
Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in August.@#%^&*3
Moreover, a recent government report@#%^&*4
showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing@#%^&*4
had contributed to perceptions@#%^&*4
that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl.@#%^&*4
But many economists pointed to a 1.8% September rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category.@#%^&*5
That "suggests@#%^&*6
the manufacturing sector is not falling apart,"@#%^&*6
said Sally Kleinman, an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York.@#%^&*6
She added, however:@#%^&*7
"It is not robust by any means."@#%^&*7
While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total,@#%^&*8
an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up.@#%^&*8
Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56%,@#%^&*9
and a government analyst said@#%^&*9
nearly all areas saw increases,@#%^&*9
including airplanes, missiles, ships, tanks and communications equipment.@#%^&*9
Orders for military goods usually catapult in September,@#%^&*10
government officials say,@#%^&*10
as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money@#%^&*10
before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.@#%^&*10
While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations,@#%^&*11
a Commerce Department analyst said@#%^&*11
that the adjustment probably didn't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders.@#%^&*11
Without the increase in defense bookings,@#%^&*12
September orders would have plummeted 3.9%.@#%^&*12
Analysts were most unsettled by evidence@#%^&*13
the backlog of orders at factories is slipping.@#%^&*13
Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4% in September, to $476.14 billion,@#%^&*14
after declining for the first time in 2 1/2 years in August.@#%^&*14
In July unfilled orders grew 1%.@#%^&*15
But analysts noted@#%^&*16
that@#%^&*16
excluding transportation-@#%^&*16
where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures-@#%^&*16
order backlogs have declined for three months in a row.@#%^&*16
"It means we're eating into the bread@#%^&*17
that keeps us going.@#%^&*17
That is a little disturbing,"@#%^&*18
Ms. Kleinman said.@#%^&*18
"It also means@#%^&*19
if you have a real drop-off in orders,@#%^&*19
production will likely fall off very quickly@#%^&*19
because there is less@#%^&*19
to keep things going."@#%^&*19
Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row,@#%^&*20
posting a 5.6% drop after a 10.3% decline.@#%^&*20
Such steep drops in a category@#%^&*21
seen as a barometer of business investment@#%^&*21
would customarily be grave news for the economy.@#%^&*21
But a Commerce Department analyst said@#%^&*22
that in both months orders would have risen@#%^&*22
had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings, a category@#%^&*22
that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year.@#%^&*22
Still, Milton Hudson, senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York, said:@#%^&*23
"If you look back a half-year or so@#%^&*23
the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector.@#%^&*23
Now at least there are question marks about that,@#%^&*24
and without any question the pace of growth has slowed."@#%^&*24

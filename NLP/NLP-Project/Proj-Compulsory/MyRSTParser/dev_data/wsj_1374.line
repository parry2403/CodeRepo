The company said@#%^&*5

if it hadn't been actively repurchasing its shares,@#%^&*5
thus increasing its interest expense@#%^&*5
and reducing its interest income.@#%^&*5
Tandy had 86.3 million shares outstanding at Sept. 30, down from 90 million a year earlier.@#%^&*6
Revenue rose 5% to $986 million from $937 million.@#%^&*7
Tandy said@#%^&*8
consumer electronics sales at its Radio Shack stores have been slow,@#%^&*8
partly because of a lack of hot, new products.@#%^&*8
"Radio Shack continues to be lackluster,"@#%^&*9
said Dennis Telzrow, analyst with Eppler, Guerin & Turner in Dallas.@#%^&*9
He said@#%^&*10
Tandy "has done a decent job"@#%^&*10
increasing sales@#%^&*10
by manufacturing computers for others@#%^&*10
and expanding sales of its Grid Systems Corp. subsidiary, which sells computers to bigger businesses,@#%^&*10
but "it's not enough@#%^&*10
to offset the problems at Radio Shack."@#%^&*10
Sales at Radio Shack stores open more than a year grew only 2% in the quarter from a year earlier,@#%^&*11
he said.@#%^&*11

Tandy earned $88.8 million, or $3.64 a share, in the year@#%^&*13
ended June 30.@#%^&*13
Barry Bryant, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said@#%^&*14
Tandy also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers@#%^&*14
aimed at the home and small-office market,@#%^&*14
which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers@#%^&*14
aimed at the corporate market.@#%^&*14
Tandy has added several new products to that line,@#%^&*15
including a laptop computer@#%^&*15
priced around $1,000,@#%^&*15
and is focusing its advertising on the easy-to-use software@#%^&*15
that is packaged with its machines.@#%^&*15
Mr. Bryant and other analysts hope@#%^&*16
all those moves will combine@#%^&*16
to help Tandy's results improve in the important Christmas quarter.@#%^&*16
"They've been promising 13% to 15% growth@#%^&*17
based on the strategic moves@#%^&*17
they've made,"@#%^&*17
he said.@#%^&*17
"If the earnings acceleration is to take place,@#%^&*18
that should be the quarter."@#%^&*18

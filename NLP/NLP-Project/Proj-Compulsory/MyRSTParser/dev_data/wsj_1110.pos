the Commerce Department reported.@#%^&*DT	NNP	NNP	VBD	.	
Orders for military equipment, household appliances, machinery and other goods@#%^&*NNS	IN	JJ	NN	,	NN	NNS	,	NN	CC	JJ	NNS

after leaping 3.9% in August,@#%^&*IN	VBG	CD	NN	IN	NNP	,	
the department said.@#%^&*DT	NN	VBD	.	
Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in August.@#%^&*JJS	NNS	VBD	VBN	DT	JJR	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	.	
Moreover, a recent government report@#%^&*RB	,	DT	JJ	NN	NN	
showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing@#%^&*VBG	JJ	NNS	IN	NN	
had contributed to perceptions@#%^&*VBD	VBN	TO	NNS	
that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl.@#%^&*IN	DT	VBG	NN	IN	DT	NN	VBD	VBN	TO	DT	NN	.	
But many economists pointed to a 1.8% September rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category.@#%^&*CC	JJ	NNS	VBD	TO	DT	CD	NN	NNP	NN	IN	NNS	IN	DT	JJ	NN	NN	.	
That "suggests@#%^&*DT	``	VBZ

said Sally Kleinman, an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York.@#%^&*VBD	NNP	NNP	,	DT	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	IN	NNP	NNP	.	
She added, however:@#%^&*PRP	VBD	,	RB	:

While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total,@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	IN	NNS	IN	NNS	CC	JJ	NNS	VBD	RP	DT	NNS	NN	,	
an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up.@#%^&*DT	JJ	NN	IN	NNS	IN	JJ	JJ	NN	VBD	PRP	RP	.	
Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56%,@#%^&*NNS	IN	NN	NN	NNS	VBD	CD	NN	,

nearly all areas saw increases,@#%^&*RB	DT	NNS	VBD	NNS	,

a Commerce Department analyst said@#%^&*DT	NNP	NNP	NN	VBD	
that the adjustment probably didn't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders.@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	RB	VBD	RB	VB	RP	DT	IN	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NN	NNS	.	
Without the increase in defense bookings,@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	IN	NN	NNS	,	
September orders would have plummeted 3.9%.@#%^&*NNP	NNS	MD	VB	VBN	CD	NN	.

Such steep drops in a category@#%^&*JJ	JJ	NNS	IN	DT	NN	
seen as a barometer of business investment@#%^&*VBN	IN	DT	NN	IN	NN	NN	
would customarily be grave news for the economy.@#%^&*MD	RB	VB	JJ	NN	IN	DT	NN	.

that in both months orders would have risen@#%^&*IN	IN	DT	NNS	NNS	MD	VB	VBN

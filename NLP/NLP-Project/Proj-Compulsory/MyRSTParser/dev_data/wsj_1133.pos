President Bush is considering casting a line-item veto as a test@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBZ	VBG	VBG	DT	JJ	NN	IN	DT	NN	
to determine@#%^&*TO	VB	
whether the courts will rule@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	MD	VB	
that he has such authority.@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBZ	JJ	NN	.	
Mr. Bush has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBZ	RB	VBN	IN	NN	IN	DT	NN	CC	DT	JJ	NN	
that would explicitly give him a line-item veto,@#%^&*WDT	MD	RB	VB	PRP	DT	JJ	NN	,	
which would enable him to kill individual items in a big spending bill@#%^&*WDT	MD	VB	PRP	TO	VB	JJ	NNS	IN	DT	JJ	NN	NN	
without having to kill the entire bill.@#%^&*IN	VBG	TO	VB	DT	JJ	NN	.	
He has argued@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	VBN	
that such presidential power is necessary@#%^&*IN	JJ	JJ	NN	VBZ	JJ	
to rein in congressional spending.@#%^&*TO	VB	IN	JJ	NN	.	
But some analysts, particularly conservative legal scholars, have urged Mr. Bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert@#%^&*CC	DT	NNS	,	RB	JJ	JJ	NNS	,	VBP	VBN	NNP	NNP	RB	TO	VB	IN	JJ	NN	CC	RB	TO	VB	
that the Constitution already implicitly gives him the power@#%^&*IN	DT	NNP	RB	RB	VBZ	PRP	DT	NN	
to exercise a line-item veto.@#%^&*TO	VB	DT	JJ	NN	.	
Such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from Congress@#%^&*PDT	DT	NN	RBS	RB	MD	VB	IN	DT	NN	NN	IN	NNP	
that would clarify@#%^&*WDT	MD	VB	
whether a president already has such power.@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	RB	VBZ	JJ	NN	.

Mr. Bush is "interested" in finding a suitable test case.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBZ	``	JJ	''	IN	VBG	DT	JJ	NN	NN	.	
But he also said@#%^&*CC	PRP	RB	VBD	
that exercising a test line-item veto isn't a "top initiative" on the president's agenda@#%^&*IN	VBG	DT	NN	JJ	NN	VBZ	RB	DT	``	JJ	NN	''	IN	DT	NN	POS	NN	
because he faces more-pressing budget issues at the moment.@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBZ	JJ	NN	NNS	IN	DT	NN	.

The New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's chief oil futures marketplace, is at a critical juncture.@#%^&*DT	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	,	DT	NN	POS	JJ	NN	NNS	NN	,	VBZ	IN	DT	JJ	NN	.	
Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think@#%^&*JJ	JJ	NNS	IN	DT	NNS	NN	VBP	
the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules.@#%^&*DT	NNS	IN	DT	NNP	IN	DT	JJ	NN	MD	VB	VBN	TO	DT	JJ	NN	IN	WRB	RB	PRP$	JJ	JJ	NN	NNS	NN	VBZ	CC	WRB	JJ	PRP$	JJ	NN	VBZ	IN	VBG	DT	NN	IN	NN	IN	NN	NNS	IN	NN	CC	NNP	NNPS	NNP	NNP	NNS	.	
If the exchange falters in these moves,@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	VBZ	IN	DT	NNS	,

it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor, the Commodity Exchange.@#%^&*PRP	MD	RB	RB	VB	IN	PRP$	JJ	NNP	NNP	NN	,	DT	NNP	NNP	.	
On Friday, the Merc's board announced@#%^&*IN	NNP	,	DT	NNP	POS	NN	VBD

The CFTC has 90 days to respond to such applications.@#%^&*DT	NNP	VBZ	CD	NNS	TO	VB	TO	JJ	NNS	.	
The Merc first started working on developing this contract in 1984.@#%^&*DT	NNP	RB	VBD	VBG	IN	VBG	DT	NN	IN	CD	.	
Only three weeks earlier, the Merc had turned to one of its own executives, 40-year-old R. Patrick Thompson,@#%^&*RB	CD	NNS	RBR	,	DT	NNP	VBD	VBN	TO	CD	IN	PRP$	JJ	NNS	,	JJ	NNP	NNP	NNP	,	
to replace Rosemary T. McFadden as president.@#%^&*TO	VB	NNP	NNP	NNP	IN	NN	.	
Mr. Thompson is believed to have a mandate from the board of directors@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBZ	VBN	TO	VB	DT	NN	IN	DT	NN	IN	NNS

whose floor traders don't follow the rules very well.@#%^&*WP$	NN	NNS	VBP	RB	VB	DT	NNS	RB	RB	.	
Ms. McFadden had been forced out in July in a bitter power struggle with Z. Lou Guttman, chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	VBN	VBN	RP	IN	NNP	IN	DT	JJ	NN	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	,	NN	CC	DT	JJ	NN	NN	IN	DT	NN	.

Mr. Thompson first came to the exchange in 1981@#%^&*NNP	NNP	RB	VBD	TO	DT	NN	IN	CD	
and has been executive vice president since March 1988.@#%^&*CC	VBZ	VBN	JJ	NN	NN	IN	NNP	CD	.	
He previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel.@#%^&*PRP	RB	VBD	NNS	IN	JJ	NN	NN	IN	NN	CC	JJ	NN	NN	CC	JJ	NN	.	
By contrast, the Comex in July imported a highly regarded outsider, Arnold F. Staloff, as its president.@#%^&*IN	NN	,	DT	NNP	IN	NNP	VBD	DT	RB	JJ	NN	,	NNP	NNP	NNP	,	IN	PRP$	NN	.	
Mr. Staloff, 44, was a senior officer of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange@#%^&*NNP	NNP	,	CD	,	VBD	DT	JJ	NN	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	NNP

Mr. Thompson isn't bereft of experience with new products, however.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBZ	RB	JJ	IN	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	,	RB	.	
For the past two years,@#%^&*IN	DT	JJ	CD	NNS	,

The Merc's extremely successful contracts in crude oil, gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in New York, and third behind the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.@#%^&*DT	NNP	VBZ	RB	JJ	NNS	IN	JJ	NN	,	NN	CC	NN	NN	VBP	VBN	PRP	DT	JJS	NNS	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	,	CC	JJ	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	IN	NNP	CC	NNP	NNP	NNP	.	
In a recent interview, Mr. Thompson said@#%^&*IN	DT	JJ	NN	,	NNP	NNP	VBD	
the biggest problem@#%^&*DT	JJS	NN	
facing all commodity exchanges@#%^&*VBG	DT	NN	NNS	
was one of image.@#%^&*VBD	CD	IN	NN	.	
Earlier this year, the U.S. attorney indicted 45 floor traders and one clerk at the two big Chicago exchanges.@#%^&*RBR	DT	NN	,	DT	NNP	NN	VBD	CD	NN	NNS	CC	CD	NN	IN	DT	CD	JJ	NNP	NNS	.	
Federal authorities in New York started investigating exchanges in May,@#%^&*JJ	NNS	IN	NNP	NNP	VBD	VBG	NNS	IN	NNP	,	
though no indictments have been handed down there.@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	VBP	VBN	VBN	RP	RB	.	
So far they have issued scores of subpoenas,@#%^&*RB	RB	PRP	VBP	VBN	NNS	IN	NNS	,	
some of which went to members of the New York Merc.@#%^&*DT	IN	WDT	VBD	TO	NNS	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	NNP	.	
Mr. Thompson will have to face some of the consequences of those subpoenas.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	MD	VB	TO	VB	DT	IN	DT	NNS	IN	DT	NNS	.	
In a recent General Accounting Office study, the Merc was found to have been the most lax in enforcing exchange rules.@#%^&*IN	DT	JJ	NNP	NNP	NNP	NN	,	DT	NNP	VBD	VBN	TO	VB	VBN	DT	RBS	JJ	IN	VBG	NN	NNS	.

The Merc received considerable criticism in 1987@#%^&*DT	NNP	VBD	JJ	NN	IN	CD	
when it was discovered that its compliance director, Kevin P. Conway,@#%^&*WRB	PRP	VBD	VBN	IN	PRP$	NN	NN	,	NNP	NNP	NNP	,

Mr. Conway is no longer at the exchange.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBZ	DT	RBR	IN	DT	NN	.

"We recognized the problem@#%^&*``	PRP	VBD	DT	NN

that@#%^&*IN	
even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly,@#%^&*RB	IN	DT	JJ	NN	NN	VBZ	NN	IN	DT	NN	RB	,	
the 1990 business plan calls for having adequate compliance people@#%^&*DT	CD	NN	NN	VBZ	IN	VBG	JJ	NN	NNS

that exchange rules are being followed.@#%^&*IN	NN	NNS	VBP	VBG	VBN	.

in order to improve the efficiency of their operations.@#%^&*IN	NN	TO	VB	DT	NN	IN	PRP$	NNS	.	
Periodically, there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges.@#%^&*RB	,	EX	VBZ	RB	VBN	NN	IN	NNS	IN	CD	CC	JJR	NNS	.	
So far there is little to show for such efforts.@#%^&*RB	RB	EX	VBZ	JJ	TO	VB	IN	JJ	NNS	.	
Mr. Thompson believes@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBZ	
the case@#%^&*DT	NN

He thinks@#%^&*PRP	VBZ

where no vested interests have built up.@#%^&*WRB	DT	JJ	NNS	VBP	VBN	RP	.	
One of those areas is the development of a hand-held electronic device@#%^&*CD	IN	DT	NNS	VBZ	DT	NN	IN	DT	JJ	JJ	NN

The GAO has recommended the creation of a system@#%^&*DT	NNP	VBZ	VBN	DT	NN	IN	DT	NN

The Chicago exchanges also are working on such a device.@#%^&*DT	NNP	NNS	RB	VBP	VBG	IN	PDT	DT	NN	.	
Another major electronics problem faces Mr. Thompson@#%^&*DT	JJ	NN	NN	VBZ	NNP	NNP

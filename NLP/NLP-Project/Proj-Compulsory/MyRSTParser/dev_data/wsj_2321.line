With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening,@#%^&*1
many Japanese had feared last week's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.@#%^&*1
They expected a new barrage of demands@#%^&*2
that Japan do something quickly@#%^&*2
to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S.@#%^&*2
Instead, they got a discussion of the need@#%^&*3
for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view.@#%^&*3
Mrs. Hills' first trip to Japan as America's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.@#%^&*4
Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices@#%^&*5
that supposedly inhibit free trade.@#%^&*5
He said@#%^&*6
such results should be "measurable in dollars and cents"@#%^&*6
in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.@#%^&*6
But Mrs. Hills,@#%^&*7
speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday,@#%^&*7
stressed@#%^&*7
that the objective "is not to get definitive action by spring or summer,@#%^&*7
it is rather to have a blueprint for action."@#%^&*7
She added@#%^&*8
that she expected "perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step@#%^&*8
to convince the American people and the Japanese people@#%^&*8
that we're moving in earnest."@#%^&*8
How such remarks translate into policy won't become clear for months.@#%^&*9
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills.@#%^&*10
Many called it simply a contrast in styles.@#%^&*11
But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic.@#%^&*12
Others said@#%^&*13
the Bush administration may feel@#%^&*13
the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand.@#%^&*13
And some said@#%^&*14
it reflected the growing debate in Washington@#%^&*14
over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade.@#%^&*14
Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher's,@#%^&*15
Mrs. Hills replied:@#%^&*15
"I didn't hear every word@#%^&*15
he spoke,@#%^&*15
but as a general proposition,@#%^&*15
I think@#%^&*15
we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration."@#%^&*15
Yet more than one American official@#%^&*16
who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials@#%^&*16
said@#%^&*16
her tone often was surprisingly "conciliatory."@#%^&*16
"I think@#%^&*17
my line has been very consistent,"@#%^&*17
Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon.@#%^&*17
"I am painted sometimes as ferocious,@#%^&*18
perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes@#%^&*18
to implement.@#%^&*18
I don't feel very ferocious.@#%^&*19
I don't feel either hard or soft.@#%^&*20
I feel committed to the program@#%^&*21
of opening markets and expanding trade."@#%^&*21
When she met the local press for the first time on Friday,@#%^&*22
Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress@#%^&*22
in removing barriers to trade in forest products, satellites and supercomputers, three areas@#%^&*22
targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill.@#%^&*22
She highlighted exclusionary business practices@#%^&*23
that the U.S. government has identified.@#%^&*23
But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition.@#%^&*24
She said@#%^&*25
the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors@#%^&*25
and shouldn't be tackled@#%^&*25
by setting quantitative targets.@#%^&*25
At her news conference for Japanese reporters, one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief.@#%^&*26
"My impression was that you would be a scary old lady,"@#%^&*27
he said,@#%^&*27
drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues.@#%^&*27
"But I am relieved to see@#%^&*28
that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity."@#%^&*28
Mrs. Hills' remarks did raise questions, at least among some U.S. officials,@#%^&*29
about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market.@#%^&*29
The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10% for years.@#%^&*30
Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement@#%^&*31
as assuring U.S. companies a 20% share by 1991,@#%^&*31
but the Japanese have denied making any such promise.@#%^&*31
At one of her news conferences, Mrs. Hills said,@#%^&*32
"I believe@#%^&*32
we can do much better than 20%."@#%^&*32
But she stressed,@#%^&*33
"I am against managed trade.@#%^&*33
I will not enter into an agreement@#%^&*34
that stipulates to a percentage of the market."@#%^&*34

The 50-50 joint venture,@#%^&*DT	CD	JJ	NN	,

Also, any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators;@#%^&*RB	,	DT	NNP	NN	MD	VB	VBN	IN	JJ	JJ	NNS	:	
Ferranti is GEC's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts,@#%^&*NNP	VBZ	NNP	POS	JJ	NN	IN	JJ	JJ	NNS	NNS	,

A consortium bid, however, would diminish GEC's direct role in Ferranti@#%^&*DT	NN	NN	,	RB	,	MD	VB	NNP	POS	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	
and might consequently appease ministry officials.@#%^&*CC	MD	RB	VB	NN	NNS	.

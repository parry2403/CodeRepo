British Aerospace PLC and France's Thomson-CSF S.A. said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they are nearing an agreement@#%^&*('nearing', 'said', 'U')	
to merge their guided-missile divisions,@#%^&*('merge', 'agreement', 'U')	
greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors.@#%^&*('expanding', 'merge', 'U')	
The 50-50 joint venture,@#%^&*('venture', 'dubbed', 'U')	('venture', 'combined', 'U')	('venture', 'be', 'U')	
which may be dubbed Eurodynamics,@#%^&*('dubbed', 'venture', 'U')	
would have combined annual sales of at least #1.4 billion@#%^&*('combined', 'ROOT', 'R')	
($2.17 billion)@#%^&*
and would be among the world's largest missile makers.@#%^&*('be', 'combined', 'U')	
After two years of talks, plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced@#%^&*('advanced', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'companies', 'U')	
for the companies to seek French and British government clearance.@#%^&*('companies', 'advanced', 'U')	
The companies hope for a final agreement by year-end.@#%^&*('hope', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies,@#%^&*('strengthen', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting.@#%^&*('make', 'strengthen', 'U')	
In recent months, a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture.@#%^&*('reshaped', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Already, British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system.@#%^&*('collaborate', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Just last week they announced@#%^&*('announced', 'ROOT', 'R')	('they', 'make', 'U')	
they may make a joint bid@#%^&*('make', 'announced', 'U')	
to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC, a smaller British defense contractor@#%^&*('buy', 'make', 'U')	
rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit.@#%^&*('rocked', 'contractor', 'U')	
The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF@#%^&*('romance', 'stirring', 'U')	
-- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts --@#%^&*('competitors', 'romance', 'U')	
is stirring controversy in Western Europe's defense industry.@#%^&*('stirring', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals,@#%^&*('rivals', 'ROOT', 'R')	
including Matra S.A. in France and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC.@#%^&*('S.A.', 'rivals', 'U')	('PLC.', 'rivals', 'U')	
But neither Matra nor GEC@#%^&*('But', 'sitting', 'U')	('neither', 'sitting', 'U')	('Matra', 'sitting', 'U')	('GEC', 'sitting', 'U')	
-- unrelated to Stamford, Conn.-based General Electric Co. --@#%^&*('unrelated', 'Matra', 'U')	
are sitting quietly by@#%^&*('sitting', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as their competitors join forces.@#%^&*('competitors', 'sitting', 'U')	
Yesterday, a source close to GEC confirmed@#%^&*('confirmed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that his company may join the Ferranti fight, as part of a possible consortium@#%^&*('join', 'confirmed', 'U')	('part', 'confirmed', 'U')	('consortium', 'bid', 'U')	
that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF.@#%^&*('bid', 'consortium', 'U')	
Companies@#%^&*('Companies', 'had', 'U')	('Companies', 'include', 'U')	
with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid@#%^&*('had', 'Companies', 'U')	
include Matra, Britain's Dowty Group PLC, West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, and France's Dassault group.@#%^&*('include', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But it may be weeks@#%^&*('weeks', 'indicated', 'U')	
before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid,@#%^&*('GEC', 'weeks', 'U')	('decide', 'weeks', 'U')	('decide', 'indicated', 'U')	('the', 'source', 'U')	
the source indicated.@#%^&*('indicated', 'ROOT', 'R')	
GEC plans first to study Ferranti's financial accounts,@#%^&*('plans', 'ROOT', 'R')	('accounts', 'said', 'U')	('accounts', 'included', 'U')	('accounts', 'merged', 'U')	
which@#%^&*('auditors', 'said', 'U')	
auditors recently said@#%^&*('said', 'accounts', 'U')	
included #215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit, International Signal & Control Group,@#%^&*('included', 'said', 'U')	('Signal', 'accounts', 'U')	('Group', 'accounts', 'U')	
with which Ferranti merged last year.@#%^&*('merged', 'accounts', 'U')	
Also, any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators;@#%^&*('blocked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Ferranti is GEC's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts,@#%^&*('competitor', 'blocked', 'U')	
and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country's defense industry.@#%^&*('heighten', 'blocked', 'U')	('heighten', 'competitor', 'U')	
A consortium bid, however, would diminish GEC's direct role in Ferranti@#%^&*('bid', 'appease', 'U')	('diminish', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and might consequently appease ministry officials.@#%^&*('appease', 'diminish', 'U')	
A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti:@#%^&*('appeared', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Competition is the name of the game,"@#%^&*('name', 'said', 'U')	
she said.@#%^&*('said', 'appeared', 'U')	
At least one potential GEC partner, Matra, insists@#%^&*('insists', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it isn't interested in Ferranti.@#%^&*('interested', 'insists', 'U')	
"We have nothing to say about this affair,@#%^&*('have', 'said', 'U')	('affair', 'concern', 'U')	
which doesn't concern us,"@#%^&*('concern', 'affair', 'U')	
a Matra official said Sunday.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The missile venture,@#%^&*('venture', 'response', 'U')	
the British Aerospace spokeswoman said,@#%^&*('said', 'response', 'U')	('is', 'response', 'U')	('a', 'response', 'U')	
is a needed response to the "new environment" in defense contracting.@#%^&*('response', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries;@#%^&*('come', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and Middle East sales, a traditional mainstay for both companies' exports, have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices.@#%^&*('hurt', 'come', 'U')	
The venture's importance for Thomson is great.@#%^&*('great', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Thomson feels@#%^&*('feels', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans.@#%^&*('depends', 'feels', 'U')	
The European defense industry is consolidating;@#%^&*('consolidating', 'ROOT', 'R')	
for instance, West Germany's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain's Plessey Co.,@#%^&*('joined', 'consolidating', 'U')	
and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b. H.@#%^&*('agreed', 'consolidating', 'U')	
In missiles, Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival, France's Aerospatiale S.A.;@#%^&*('overshadowed', 'need', 'U')	
to better compete,@#%^&*('compete', 'say', 'U')	
Thomson officials say,@#%^&*('say', 'overshadowed', 'U')	
they need a partnership.@#%^&*('need', 'ROOT', 'R')	
To justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture,@#%^&*('justify', 'make', 'U')	
Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace.@#%^&*('make', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Annual revenue of British Aerospace's missile business is about #950 million,@#%^&*('million', 'said', 'U')	('a', 'spokesman', 'U')	
a Thomson spokesman said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
British Aerospace's chief missile products include its 17-year-old family of Rapier surface-to-air missiles.@#%^&*('include', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Thomson missile products, with about half British Aerospace's annual revenue, include the Crotale surface-to-air missile family.@#%^&*('include', 'ROOT', 'R')

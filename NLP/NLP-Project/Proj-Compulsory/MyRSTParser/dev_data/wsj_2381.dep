big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry@#%^&*('put', 'ROOT', 'R')

They could still panic@#%^&*('They', 'bail', 'U')	('panic', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and bail out of the market.@#%^&*('bail', 'panic', 'U')	
But their 1987 performance indicates@#%^&*('indicates', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that they won't abandon stocks@#%^&*('abandon', 'indicates', 'U')	
unless conditions get far worse.@#%^&*('worse', 'abandon', 'U')	
"Last time, we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks@#%^&*('rewarded', 'said', 'U')

big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms@#%^&*('decide', 'ROOT', 'R')	
without jettisoning stock.@#%^&*('jettisoning', 'ride', 'U')	
Most often, they do just that,@#%^&*('do', 'ROOT', 'R')

attracting about $1 trillion from pension funds alone.@#%^&*('attracting', 'do', 'U')

by selling waves of S&P futures contracts.@#%^&*('selling', 'generate', 'U')

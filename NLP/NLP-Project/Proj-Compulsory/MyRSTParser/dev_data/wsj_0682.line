Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July's crash of a United Airlines flight in Iowa:@#%^&*1
a structural flaw@#%^&*1
that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk.@#%^&*1
For several months, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have suspected@#%^&*2
that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack@#%^&*2
that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight.@#%^&*2
The explosion sent shards of metal flying,@#%^&*3
severing the DC-10's hydraulic or control systems,@#%^&*3
and led to the crash@#%^&*3
that killed 112 people.@#%^&*3
But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232's tail engine from a cornfield near the Sioux City Airport in Iowa.@#%^&*4
The safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in Sioux City.@#%^&*5
Among the issues@#%^&*6
the board will examine@#%^&*6
is whether United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks.@#%^&*6
The engine involved was a CF6-6@#%^&*7
made by General Electric Co.@#%^&*7
Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, said@#%^&*8
that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate@#%^&*8
that a flaw@#%^&*8
-- known as "hard alpha" --@#%^&*8
occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago.@#%^&*8
He said@#%^&*9
there wasn't any way@#%^&*9
to detect the flaw at that time,@#%^&*9
and that the process has since been changed@#%^&*9
to decrease the chance@#%^&*9
that such flaws would occur.@#%^&*9
The FAA already has ordered@#%^&*10
that all 232 disks@#%^&*10
made by the old process@#%^&*10
be removed from the planes@#%^&*10
and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water-submersion chamber.@#%^&*10
Such tests make the FAA confident that a Sioux City-type accident "won't happen again,"@#%^&*11
said Mr. Broderick.@#%^&*11
A spokesman for GE said@#%^&*12
that the company has been working with the FAA all along on this issue@#%^&*12
and "will comply fully with the required inspections."@#%^&*12
But he also pointed out@#%^&*13
that the recalls will have no impact on GE's engine production.@#%^&*13
The CF6-6 series engines aren't being manufactured any more;@#%^&*14
they are only being used in the DC-10 Series 10 planes currently in service,@#%^&*14
he said.@#%^&*14

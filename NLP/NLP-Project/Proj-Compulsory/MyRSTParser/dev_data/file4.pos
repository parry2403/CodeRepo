The government is sharpening its newest weapon against white-collar defendants :@#%^&*DT	NN	VBZ	VBG	PRP$	JJS	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	:	
the power@#%^&*DT	NN	
to prevent them from paying their legal bills.@#%^&*TO	VB	PRP	IN	VBG	PRP$	JJ	NNS	.	
And defense lawyers are warning@#%^&*CC	NN	NNS	VBP	VBG	
that they won't stick around@#%^&*IN	PRP	MD	RB	VB	IN	
if they don't get paid.@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBP	RB	VB	VBN	.	
The issue has come to a boil in Newark, N.J.,@#%^&*DT	NN	VBZ	VBN	TO	DT	NN	IN	NNP	,	NNP	,	
where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for Eddie Antar@#%^&*WRB	JJ	NNS	VBP	VBN	NNS	IN	NNP	NNP	
that@#%^&*IN	
if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted,@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	CC	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	VBZ	VBN	,	
the government may move to seize the money@#%^&*DT	NN	MD	VB	TO	VB	DT	NN	
that Mr. Antar is using to pay legal fees.@#%^&*IN	NNP	NNP	VBZ	VBG	TO	VB	JJ	NNS	.	
The warning by the U.S. attorney's office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June.@#%^&*DT	NN	IN	DT	NNP	NN	POS	NN	VBZ	CD	NNS	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	NNP	JJ	NNP	.	
In those cases, the high court ruled@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	,	DT	JJ	NN	VBD	
that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority@#%^&*IN	JJ	NN	VBZ	NNS	JJ	NN	
to seize assets of people@#%^&*TO	VB	NNS	IN	NNS	
accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes,@#%^&*VBN	IN	NN	CC	JJ	NNS	,	
including fees@#%^&*VBG	NNS	
paid to lawyers before an indictment.@#%^&*VBN	TO	NNS	IN	DT	NN	.	
If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. Antar's assets,@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	VBZ	IN	VBG	NNP	NNP	POS	NNS	,	
he could be left without top-flight legal representation,@#%^&*PRP	MD	VB	VBN	IN	JJ	JJ	NN	,	
because his attorneys are likely to quit,@#%^&*IN	PRP$	NNS	VBP	JJ	TO	VB	,	
according to individuals familiar with the case.@#%^&*VBG	TO	NNS	JJ	IN	DT	NN	.	
A seizure also would make the case the largest@#%^&*DT	NN	RB	MD	VB	DT	NN	DT	JJS	
-- and one of the first --@#%^&*:	CC	CD	IN	DT	JJ	:	
in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution@#%^&*IN	WDT	NNS	POS	NNS	VBP	VBN	VBN	IN	DT	NN	
unrelated to drugs.@#%^&*JJ	TO	NNS	.	
"The people@#%^&*``	DT	NNS	
who suffer in the short run@#%^&*WP	VBP	IN	DT	JJ	NN

but the people@#%^&*CC	DT	NNS	
who suffer in the long run@#%^&*WP	VBP	IN	DT	JJ	NN	
are all of the people,@#%^&*VBP	DT	IN	DT	NNS	,	
because there won't be a vigorous private bar@#%^&*IN	EX	MD	RB	VB	DT	JJ	JJ	NN	
to defend the Bill of Rights,"@#%^&*TO	VB	DT	NNP	IN	NNPS	,	''	
says Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense attorney@#%^&*VBZ	NNP	NNP	,	DT	JJ	NN	NN	
who says@#%^&*WP	VBZ	
he has turned down a number of cases@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	VBN	RP	DT	NN	IN	NNS	
to avoid possible fee seizures.@#%^&*TO	VB	JJ	NN	NNS	.	
Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark,@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBZ	VBG	VBN	IN	DT	JJ	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	,	
where prosecutors have told him@#%^&*WRB	NNS	VBP	VBN	PRP	
that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges.@#%^&*IN	PRP	MD	RB	VB	DT	NN	IN	NN	CC	NNS	NN	NNS	.	
Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, the government has the authority@#%^&*IN	DT	NNP	NNP	CC	NNP	NNP	NN	,	CC	NNP	,	DT	NN	VBZ	DT	NN	
to seek to freeze or seize a defendant's assets before trial.@#%^&*TO	VB	TO	VB	CC	VB	DT	NN	POS	NNS	IN	NN	.	
According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar's case,@#%^&*VBG	TO	NNS	JJ	IN	NNP	NNP	POS	NN	,	
prosecutors issued their warning this week@#%^&*NNS	VBD	PRP$	NN	DT	NN	
after one of Mr. Antar's attorneys asked@#%^&*IN	CD	IN	NNP	NNP	POS	NNS	VBD	
whether legal fees might be subject to seizure.@#%^&*IN	JJ	NNS	MD	VB	JJ	TO	NN	.	
In a letter, prosecutors told Mr. Antar's lawyers@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	,	NNS	VBD	NNP	NNP	POS	NNS	
that@#%^&*IN	
because of the recent Supreme Court rulings,@#%^&*IN	IN	DT	JJ	NNP	NNP	NNS	,	
they could expect@#%^&*PRP	MD	VB	
that any fees@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	
collected from Mr. Antar@#%^&*VBN	IN	NNP	NNP	
may be seized.@#%^&*MD	VB	VBN	.	
Prosecutors have told Mr. Antar's attorneys@#%^&*NNS	VBP	VBN	NNP	NNP	POS	NNS	
that they believe@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBP	
Mr. Antar's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great@#%^&*NNP	NNP	POS	RB	JJ	NNS	VBP	RB	JJ	
that any money@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	
he has used@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	VBN	
to pay attorneys@#%^&*TO	VB	NNS	
derives from illegal activities.@#%^&*VBZ	IN	JJ	NNS	.	
Therefore,@#%^&*RB	,	
they said,@#%^&*PRP	VBD	,	
the money can be taken from the lawyers@#%^&*DT	NN	MD	VB	VBN	IN	DT	NNS	
even after they are paid.@#%^&*RB	IN	PRP	VBP	VBN	.	
Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault, attorneys for Mr. Antar, both declined to comment on the matter.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	CC	NNP	NNP	,	NNS	IN	NNP	NNP	,	DT	VBD	TO	VB	IN	DT	NN	.	
In Newark, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said,@#%^&*IN	NNP	,	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	VBD	,	
"I don't think@#%^&*``	PRP	VBP	RB	VB	
there's any legal reason@#%^&*EX	VBZ	DT	JJ	NN	
to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases."@#%^&*TO	VB	NN	IN	NN	POS	NNS	TO	NN	NNS	.	''	
Mr. Alito said@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	
his office "just responded to an attorney's question@#%^&*PRP$	NN	``	RB	VBD	TO	DT	NN	POS	NN	
about whether we would go after attorney's fees,@#%^&*IN	IN	PRP	MD	VB	IN	NN	POS	NNS	,	
and that is different from actually doing it,@#%^&*CC	DT	VBZ	JJ	IN	RB	VBG	PRP	,	
although we reserve that right."@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBP	IN	NN	.	''	
Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	VBN	JJ	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	
filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission.@#%^&*VBN	IN	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	IN	DT	NNPS	CC	NNP	NNP	.	
In that suit, the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a "massive financial fraud"@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	,	DT	NNP	VBD	NNP	NNP	IN	VBG	IN	DT	``	JJ	JJ	NN	''	
to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie, Edison, N.J., over a three-year period.@#%^&*TO	VB	DT	NNS	IN	NNP	NNP	,	NNP	,	NNP	,	IN	DT	JJ	NN	.	
Through his lawyers, Mr. Antar has denied allegations in the SEC suit and in civil suits@#%^&*IN	PRP$	NNS	,	NNP	NNP	VBZ	VBN	NNS	IN	DT	NNP	NN	CC	IN	JJ	NNS	
previously filed by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others.@#%^&*RB	VBN	IN	NNS	IN	NNP	NNP	CC	NNS	.	
The SEC has alleged@#%^&*DT	NNP	VBZ	VBN	
that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements@#%^&*IN	NNP	NNP	VBD	TO	VB	RP	DT	NN	POS	NN	NN	IN	JJ	JJ	NNS	
in order to sell his stake@#%^&*IN	NN	TO	VB	PRP$	NN	
and reap huge profits.@#%^&*CC	VB	JJ	NNS	.	
Mr. Antar,@#%^&*NNP	NNP	,	
the SEC said,@#%^&*DT	NNP	VBD	,	
made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987.@#%^&*VBD	JJR	IN	$	CD	CD	IN	DT	NN	IN	PRP$	NNS	IN	CD	CC	CD	.	
The Justice Department has emphasized@#%^&*DT	NNP	NNP	VBZ	VBN	
that the government's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly.@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	POS	NN	NN	VBZ	TO	VB	VBN	RB	.	
According to department policy,@#%^&*VBG	TO	NN	NN	,	
prosecutors must make a strong showing@#%^&*NNS	MD	VB	DT	JJ	NN	
that lawyers ' fees came from assets@#%^&*IN	NNS	POS	NNS	VBD	IN	NNS	
tainted by illegal profits@#%^&*VBN	IN	JJ	NNS	
before any attempts at seizure are made.@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	IN	NN	VBP	VBN	.	
Still, criminal defense lawyers worry@#%^&*RB	,	JJ	NN	NNS	VBP	
that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial@#%^&*IN	NNS	VBP	VBG	VBN	IN	PRP$	NNP	NNP	NN	TO	NN	CC	DT	JJ	NN	
if the government can seize lawyers ' fees.@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	MD	VB	NNS	POS	NNS	.	
They also worry@#%^&*PRP	RB	VBP	
that@#%^&*IN	
if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly,@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	VBZ	NN	NNS	RB	,	
the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases@#%^&*DT	JJS	NN	NNS	MD	VB	JJ	TO	VB	JJ	NNS

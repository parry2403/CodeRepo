Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July's crash of a United Airlines flight in Iowa:@#%^&*JJ	NNS	VBP	VBN	DT	NN	IN	JJ	NNP	POS	NN	IN	DT	NNP	NNPS	NN	IN	NNP	:	
a structural flaw@#%^&*DT	JJ	NN	
that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk.@#%^&*IN	VBN	IN	DT	NN	IN	DT	NN	NN	NN	.	
For several months, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have suspected@#%^&*IN	JJ	NNS	,	NNS	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	NNP	CC	DT	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	VBP	VBN	
that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack@#%^&*IN	DT	JJ	NN	IN	DT	NN	VBD	TO	DT	NN	
that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight.@#%^&*IN	RB	VBD	DT	NN	NN	TO	VB	RB	IN	NN	.	
The explosion sent shards of metal flying,@#%^&*DT	NN	VBD	NNS	IN	NN	NN	,	
severing the DC-10's hydraulic or control systems,@#%^&*VBG	DT	NNP	POS	JJ	CC	NN	NNS	,	
and led to the crash@#%^&*CC	VBD	TO	DT	NN	
that killed 112 people.@#%^&*WDT	VBD	CD	NNS	.	
But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232's tail engine from a cornfield near the Sioux City Airport in Iowa.@#%^&*CC	NNS	MD	VB	PRP$	NN	RB	IN	DT	JJ	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	CD	POS	NN	NN	IN	DT	NN	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	NNP	IN	NNP	.	
The safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in Sioux City.@#%^&*DT	NN	NN	MD	VB	CD	NNS	IN	NNS	IN	DT	NN	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	.	
Among the issues@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	
the board will examine@#%^&*DT	NN	MD	VB	
is whether United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks.@#%^&*VBZ	IN	NNP	NNPS	,	DT	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	,	MD	VB	VBN	JJ	TO	VB	DT	NNS	IN	NN	NNS	.	
The engine involved was a CF6-6@#%^&*DT	NN	VBN	VBD	DT	NNP	
made by General Electric Co.@#%^&*VBN	IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	.	
Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, said@#%^&*NNP	NNP	,	DT	NNP	POS	JJ	NN	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	CC	NN	,	VBD	
that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate@#%^&*IN	JJ	NNS	IN	DT	VBN	NN	NN	VBP	
that a flaw@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	
-- known as "hard alpha" --@#%^&*:	VBN	IN	``	JJ	NN	''	:	
occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago.@#%^&*VBD	IN	DT	NN	IN	PRP$	NN	RB	CD	NNS	RB	.	
He said@#%^&*PRP	VBD	
there wasn't any way@#%^&*EX	VBD	RB	DT	NN	
to detect the flaw at that time,@#%^&*TO	VB	DT	NN	IN	DT	NN	,	
and that the process has since been changed@#%^&*CC	IN	DT	NN	VBZ	IN	VBN	VBN	
to decrease the chance@#%^&*TO	VB	DT	NN	
that such flaws would occur.@#%^&*IN	JJ	NNS	MD	VB	.	
The FAA already has ordered@#%^&*DT	NNP	RB	VBZ	VBN	
that all 232 disks@#%^&*IN	DT	CD	NNS	
made by the old process@#%^&*VBN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	
be removed from the planes@#%^&*VB	VBN	IN	DT	NNS	
and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water-submersion chamber.@#%^&*CC	VBN	TO	DT	JJ	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	.	
Such tests make the FAA confident that a Sioux City-type accident "won't happen again,"@#%^&*JJ	NNS	VBP	DT	NNP	JJ	IN	DT	NNP	JJ	NN	``	MD	RB	VB	RB	,	''	
said Mr. Broderick.@#%^&*VBD	NNP	NNP	.	
A spokesman for GE said@#%^&*DT	NN	IN	NNP	VBD	
that the company has been working with the FAA all along on this issue@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	VBZ	VBN	VBG	IN	DT	NNP	DT	IN	IN	DT	NN	
and "will comply fully with the required inspections."@#%^&*CC	``	MD	VB	RB	IN	DT	JJ	NNS	.	''	
But he also pointed out@#%^&*CC	PRP	RB	VBD	RP	
that the recalls will have no impact on GE's engine production.@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	MD	VB	DT	NN	IN	NNP	POS	NN	NN	.	
The CF6-6 series engines aren't being manufactured any more;@#%^&*DT	NNP	NN	NNS	VBP	RB	VBG	VBN	DT	RBR	:	
they are only being used in the DC-10 Series 10 planes currently in service,@#%^&*PRP	VBP	RB	VBG	VBN	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	CD	NNS	RB	IN	NN	,	
he said.@#%^&*PRP	VBD	.

Atco Ltd. said@#%^&*1
its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants,@#%^&*1
some valued at more than one billion Canadian dollars@#%^&*1
(US$851 million),@#%^&*1
in Great Britain and elsewhere.@#%^&*1
C.S. Richardson, Atco's senior vice president, finance, said@#%^&*2
its 50.1%-owned Canadian Utilities Ltd. unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern Canada, and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere,@#%^&*2
including Britain,@#%^&*2
where the British government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program.@#%^&*2
"The projects are big.@#%^&*3
They can be C$1 billion plus,"@#%^&*4
Mr. Richardson said.@#%^&*4
"But we wouldn't go into them alone,"@#%^&*5
and Canadian Utilities' equity stake would be small,@#%^&*5
he said.@#%^&*5
"Ideally, we'd like to be the operator {of the project} and a modest equity investor.@#%^&*6
Our long suit is our proven ability@#%^&*7
to operate" power plants,@#%^&*7
he said.@#%^&*7
Mr. Richardson wouldn't offer specifics@#%^&*8
regarding Atco's proposed British project,@#%^&*8
but he said@#%^&*8
it would compete for customers with two huge British power generating companies@#%^&*8
that would be formed under the country's plan@#%^&*8
to privatize its massive water and electric utilities.@#%^&*8
Britain's government plans to raise about #20 billion@#%^&*9
($31.05 billion)@#%^&*9
from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities,@#%^&*9
beginning next month.@#%^&*9
The planned electric utility sale,@#%^&*10
scheduled for next year,@#%^&*10
is alone expected to raise #13 billion,@#%^&*10
making it the world's largest public offering.@#%^&*10
Under terms of the plan, independent generators would be able to compete for 15% of customers until 1994, and for another 10% between 1994 and 1998.@#%^&*11
Canadian Utilities had 1988 revenue of C$1.16 billion, mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in Alberta,@#%^&*12
where the company serves about 800,000 customers.@#%^&*12
"There seems to be a move around the world@#%^&*13
to deregulate the generation of electricity,"@#%^&*13
Mr. Richardson said,@#%^&*13
and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it.@#%^&*13
"This is a real thrust on our utility side,"@#%^&*14
he said,@#%^&*14
adding@#%^&*14
that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries,@#%^&*14
though he would be specific.@#%^&*14
Canadian Utilities isn't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in Britain, in anticipation of the privatization program.@#%^&*15
"We're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England,"@#%^&*16
said Bruce Stram, vice president, corporate strategy and corporate planning, with Enron Corp., Houston, a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator.@#%^&*16
Mr. Stram said@#%^&*17
Enron is considering building gas-fired power plants in the U.K. capable of producing about 500 megawatts of power at a cost of about $300 million to $400 million.@#%^&*17

It's a California crime saga worthy of an Erle Stanley Gardner title:@#%^&*1
The Case of the Purloined Palm Trees.@#%^&*1
Edward Carlson awoke one morning last month@#%^&*2
to find eight holes in his front yard@#%^&*2
where his prized miniature palms,@#%^&*2
called cycads,@#%^&*2
once stood.@#%^&*2
Days later, the thieves returned@#%^&*3
and dug out more,@#%^&*3
this time adding insult to injury.@#%^&*3
"The second time,"@#%^&*4
he says,@#%^&*4
"they left the shovel."@#%^&*4
No garden-variety crime, palm-tree rustling is sprouting up all over Southern California,@#%^&*5
bringing big bucks to crooks@#%^&*5
who know their botany.@#%^&*5
Cycads,@#%^&*6
the most popular of which is the Sago Palm,@#%^&*6
are doll-sized versions of California's famous long-necked palms, with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds.@#%^&*6
Because the Sago is relatively rare@#%^&*7
and grows only a couple of inches a year,@#%^&*7
it's a pricey lawn decoration:@#%^&*7
A two-foot tall Sago can retail for $1,000,@#%^&*7
and taller ones often fetch $3,000 or more.@#%^&*7
"Evidently, somebody has realized@#%^&*8
it's easy money to steal these things,"@#%^&*8
says Loran Whitelock, a research associate@#%^&*8
specializing in cycads@#%^&*8
at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum.@#%^&*8
Just last week, would-be thieves damaged three Sagos at Mr. Whitelock's home in the Eagle Rock section@#%^&*9
before something frightened them off, foiled.@#%^&*9
"It's hard to think someone is raping your garden,"@#%^&*10
he says.@#%^&*10
Police suspect@#%^&*11
that the criminals,@#%^&*11
who dig up the plants in the dead of night,@#%^&*11
are selling them to nurseries or landscapers.@#%^&*11
The Sago has become a popular accent in tony new housing tracts,@#%^&*12
apparently giving the rustlers a ready market for their filched fronds.@#%^&*12
Thieves are going to find "anybody@#%^&*13
who has enough bucks@#%^&*13
to plant these things in their front yard,"@#%^&*13
says William Morrissey, an investigator with the police department in Garden Grove, Calif.,@#%^&*13
where five such thefts have been reported in the past several weeks.@#%^&*13
The department is advising residents to plant Sagos,@#%^&*14
if they must,@#%^&*14
in the back yard@#%^&*14
and telling nurseries to be on the lookout for anyone@#%^&*14
trying to palm one off.@#%^&*14
But for those Californians@#%^&*15
who want exotic gardens out front@#%^&*15
where neighbors can appreciate them,@#%^&*15
there's always Harold Smith's approach.@#%^&*15
After three Sagos were stolen from his home in Garden Grove,@#%^&*16
"I put a big iron stake in the ground@#%^&*16
and tied the tree to the stake with a chain,"@#%^&*16
he says proudly.@#%^&*16
"And you can't cut this chain with bolt cutters."@#%^&*17

Exxon Corp. filed suit against the state of Alaska,@#%^&*1
charging@#%^&*1
state officials interfered with the oil company's initial efforts@#%^&*1
to treat last spring's giant oil spill.@#%^&*1
The action is a counterclaim to a suit@#%^&*2
filed by Alaska in August against Exxon and six other oil companies.@#%^&*2
The state's suit alleges@#%^&*3
that Exxon's response to the spill failed to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound.@#%^&*3
That suit and Exxon's countersuit were filed in a state court in Anchorage.@#%^&*4
Neither suit lists specific dollar claims,@#%^&*5
largely because damage assessment hasn't yet been completed.@#%^&*5
Legal strategists say@#%^&*6
that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $1 billion.@#%^&*6
Litigation,@#%^&*7
if not settled out of court,@#%^&*7
could drag on for years.@#%^&*7
Exxon said in its suit@#%^&*8
that it will seek reimbursement from the state for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims@#%^&*8
it says@#%^&*8
resulted from the state's conduct.@#%^&*8
The oil company claims@#%^&*9
that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil@#%^&*9
dumped@#%^&*9
when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef.@#%^&*9
Craig Tillery, an Alaska assistant attorney general, said in an interview last night@#%^&*10
that Exxon's accusations "are not new.@#%^&*10
Exxon has made them before,@#%^&*11
at which point the state demonstrated@#%^&*11
they were untrue.@#%^&*11
The state will vigorously defend against any counterclaim."@#%^&*12
Since the spill last March, Exxon and the state have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill,@#%^&*13
when the weather was clear and calm,@#%^&*13
would have helped limit the environmental damage.@#%^&*13
Exxon claims@#%^&*14
that use of dispersants,@#%^&*14
which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets,@#%^&*14
was a crucial part of its immediate-response plan@#%^&*14
and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather@#%^&*14
following the spill.@#%^&*14
The oil company claims@#%^&*15
that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill@#%^&*15
to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard.@#%^&*15
The state's opposition to the use of dispersants,@#%^&*16
Exxon says,@#%^&*16
caused the Coast Guard "to delay granting permission."@#%^&*16
Alaskan and Coast Guard officials say@#%^&*17
Exxon's charges aren't relevant@#%^&*17
because tests@#%^&*17
conducted during the first two days@#%^&*17
following the spill@#%^&*17
showed@#%^&*17
that the dispersant wasn't working anyway.@#%^&*17
Use of dispersants was approved@#%^&*18
when a test on the third day showed some positive results,@#%^&*18
officials said.@#%^&*18

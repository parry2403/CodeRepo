Wanted:@#%^&*1
An investment@#%^&*1
that's as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit@#%^&*1
but offers a return@#%^&*1
worth getting excited about.@#%^&*1
With $150 billion of CDs@#%^&*2
maturing this month,@#%^&*2
a lot of people have been scouring the financial landscape for just such an investment.@#%^&*2
In April,@#%^&*3
when many of them bought their CDs,@#%^&*3
six-month certificates were yielding more than 9%;@#%^&*3
investors@#%^&*3
willing to look@#%^&*3
could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts.@#%^&*3
Now, the nationwide average yield on a six-month CD is just under 8%,@#%^&*4
and 8.5% is about the best around.@#%^&*4
But investors@#%^&*5
looking for alternatives@#%^&*5
aren't finding it easy.@#%^&*5
Yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than several months ago.@#%^&*6
And the stock market's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there.@#%^&*7
"If you're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a CD,@#%^&*8
you're not going to find it,"@#%^&*8
says Washington financial planner Dennis M. Gurtz.@#%^&*8
There are, however, some alternatives@#%^&*9
that income-oriented investors should consider,@#%^&*9
investment advisers say.@#%^&*9
Short-term municipal bonds, bond funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices@#%^&*10
they mention@#%^&*10
-- and not just as a way@#%^&*10
to get a higher return.@#%^&*10
In particular,@#%^&*11
advisers say,@#%^&*11
investors may want to look at securities@#%^&*11
that reduce the risk@#%^&*11
that CD holders are confronting right now,@#%^&*11
of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short-term certificates at lower rates.@#%^&*11
A mix of CDs and other holdings may make the most sense.@#%^&*12
"People should remember@#%^&*13
their money isn't all or nothing@#%^&*13
-- they don't need to be shopping for the one interest-rate-type investment and putting all their money in it,"@#%^&*13
says Bethesda, Md., adviser Karen Schaeffer.@#%^&*13
Here's a look at some of the alternatives:@#%^&*14
SHORT-TERM MUNICIPALS:@#%^&*14
Investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators.@#%^&*14
Yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on CDs for maturities of perhaps one to five years.@#%^&*15
That's because municipal-bond interest is exempt from federal income tax@#%^&*16
-- and from state and local taxes too, for in-state investors.@#%^&*16
For an investor@#%^&*17
paying tax at a 33% rate,@#%^&*17
a seemingly puny 6% yield on a one-year muni is equivalent to a taxable 9%.@#%^&*17
Rates approach 6.5% on five-year municipals.@#%^&*18
Some of the more cautious CD holders might like "pre-refunded" municipals.@#%^&*19
These securities get top credit ratings@#%^&*20
because the issuers have put aside U.S. bonds@#%^&*20
that will be sold@#%^&*20
to pay off holders@#%^&*20
when the municipals are retired.@#%^&*20
"It's a no-brainer:@#%^&*21
You don't have to worry about diversification;@#%^&*21
you don't have to worry about quality,"@#%^&*21
says Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice president of the New York bond firm of Gabriele, Hueglin & Cashman Inc.@#%^&*21
Consider a "laddered" bond portfolio, with issues@#%^&*22
maturing in, say, 1992, 1993 and 1994,@#%^&*22
advises Malcolm A. Makin, a Westerly, R.I., financial planner.@#%^&*22
The idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates.@#%^&*23
BOND FUNDS:@#%^&*24
Bond mutual funds offer diversification@#%^&*24
and are easy to buy and sell.@#%^&*24
That makes them a reasonable option for investors@#%^&*25
who will accept some risk of price fluctuation@#%^&*25
in order to make a bet@#%^&*25
that interest rates will decline over the next year or so.@#%^&*25
Buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns@#%^&*26
if they are right.@#%^&*26
But they will have disappointing returns or even losses@#%^&*27
if interest rates rise instead.@#%^&*27
Bond resale prices, and thus fund share prices, move in the opposite direction from rates.@#%^&*28
The price movements get bigger@#%^&*29
as the maturity of the securities lengthens.@#%^&*29
Consider, for instance, two bond funds from Vanguard Group of Investment Cos.@#%^&*30
that were both yielding 8.6% on a recent day.@#%^&*31
The Short Term Bond Fund, with an average maturity of 2 1/2 years, would deliver a total return for one year of about 10.6%@#%^&*32
if rates drop one percentage point@#%^&*32
and a one-year return of about 6.6%@#%^&*32
if rates rise by the same amount.@#%^&*32
But, in the same circumstances, the returns would be a more extreme 14.6% and 2.6% for the Vanguard Bond Market Fund, with its 12 1/2-year average maturity.@#%^&*33
"You get equity-like returns" from bonds@#%^&*34
if you guess right on rates,@#%^&*34
says James E. Wilson, a Columbia, S.C., planner.@#%^&*34
If interest rates don't change,@#%^&*35
bond fund investors' returns will be about equal to the funds' current yields.@#%^&*35
DEFERRED ANNUITIES:@#%^&*36
These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts:@#%^&*36
Investment gains are compounded@#%^&*36
without tax consequences@#%^&*36
until money is withdrawn,@#%^&*36
but a 10% penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals@#%^&*36
made before age 59 1/2.@#%^&*36
Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities, or certificates of annuity.@#%^&*37
An interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years,@#%^&*38
after which holders get 30 days@#%^&*38
to choose another guarantee period@#%^&*38
or to switch to another insurer's contract@#%^&*38
without the surrender charges@#%^&*38
that are common to annuities.@#%^&*38
Some current rates exceed those on CDs.@#%^&*39
For instance, a CD-type annuity from North American Co. for Life & Health Insurance, Chicago, offers 8.8% interest for one year or a 9% rate for two years.@#%^&*40
Annuities are rarely a good idea at age 35@#%^&*41
because of the withdrawal restrictions.@#%^&*41
But at age 55, "they may be a great deal,"@#%^&*42
says Mr. Wilson, the Columbia, S.C., planner.@#%^&*42
MONEY MARKET FUNDS:@#%^&*43
That's right,@#%^&*43
money market mutual funds.@#%^&*43
The conventional wisdom is to go into money funds@#%^&*44
when rates are rising@#%^&*44
and shift out at times such as the present,@#%^&*44
when rates seem headed down.@#%^&*44
With average maturities of a month or so, money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns@#%^&*45
that track market interest rates,@#%^&*45
with a slight lag.@#%^&*45
Still, today's highest-yielding money funds may beat CDs over the next year@#%^&*46
even if rates fall,@#%^&*46
says Guy Witman, an editor of the Bond Market Advisor newsletter in Atlanta.@#%^&*46
That's because top-yielding funds currently offer yields almost 1 1/2 percentage points above the average CD yield.@#%^&*47
Mr. Witman likes the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield just under 9.5%.@#%^&*48
A new fund, its operating expenses are being temporarily subsidized by the sponsor.@#%^&*49
Try combining a money fund and an intermediate-term bond fund as a low-risk bet on falling rates,@#%^&*50
suggests Back Bay Advisors Inc., a mutual fund unit of New England Insurance Co.@#%^&*50
If rates unexpectedly rise,@#%^&*51
the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund.@#%^&*51

Tandy Corp. said@#%^&*1
it won't join U.S. Memories, the group@#%^&*1
that seeks to battle the Japanese in the market for computer memory chips.@#%^&*1
Tandy's decision is a second setback for U.S. Memories.@#%^&*2
Last month, Apple Computer Inc. said@#%^&*3
that it wouldn't invest in the group.@#%^&*3
Apple said@#%^&*4
that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development.@#%^&*4
U.S. Memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt@#%^&*5
to crack the $10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chips, a market@#%^&*5
dominated by the Japanese.@#%^&*5
Those chips were in dire shortage last year,@#%^&*6
hurting many U.S. computer companies@#%^&*6
that couldn't get sufficient Japanese-supplied chips.@#%^&*6
Tandy said@#%^&*7
its experience during the shortage didn't merit the $5 million to $50 million investment@#%^&*7
U.S. Memories is seeking from each investor.@#%^&*7
"At this time, we elected not to get involved@#%^&*8
because we have been able to satisfy our need {for DRAMs} from the market as a rule,"@#%^&*8
said Ed Juge, Tandy's director of market planning.@#%^&*8
Sanford Kane, U.S. Memories president, said@#%^&*9
the decision was "disappointing,"@#%^&*9
but doesn't presage U.S. Memories' failure.@#%^&*9
"I would like to have had them,"@#%^&*10
he said.@#%^&*10
But "they weren't on my list of companies@#%^&*11
who were critical to be a part of it."@#%^&*11
Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June,@#%^&*12
when the group was formed by seven electronics companies:@#%^&*12
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment Corp.; Hewlett-Packard Co.; Intel Corp.; International Business Machines Corp.; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp.@#%^&*12
Mr. Kane said@#%^&*13
he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in U.S. Memories@#%^&*13
soon after the group finishes a business plan, probably late this week.@#%^&*13
U.S. Memories needs a catalyst,@#%^&*14
he said,@#%^&*14
to inspire others to join.@#%^&*14
But so far, most potential participants haven't decided.@#%^&*15
Sun Microsystems Inc. said@#%^&*16
it's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories@#%^&*16
and plans to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week.@#%^&*16
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said@#%^&*17
it was waiting to see U.S. Memories' business plan.@#%^&*17

although "it isn't under active consideration."@#%^&*19

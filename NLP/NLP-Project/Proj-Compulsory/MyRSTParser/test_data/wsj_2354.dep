Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts@#%^&*('trying', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to defuse suits@#%^&*('defuse', 'efforts', 'U')	
filed by borrowers, developers and creditors.@#%^&*('filed', 'suits', 'U')	
The thrifts' lawyers claim@#%^&*('claim', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the suits,@#%^&*('that', 'dismissed', 'U')	('suits', 'dismissed', 'U')	
numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone,@#%^&*('numbering', 'suits', 'U')	
should be dismissed as moot@#%^&*('dismissed', 'claim', 'U')	
because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money@#%^&*('has', 'dismissed', 'U')	
to pay judgments.@#%^&*('pay', 'money', 'U')	
Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it,@#%^&*('have', 'concede', 'U')	
even the S&L lawyers concede there's little precedent to back their position.@#%^&*('concede', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Still, one federal appeals court has signaled@#%^&*('signaled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it's willing to entertain the notion,@#%^&*('willing', 'signaled', 'U')	('the', 'lawyers', 'U')	
and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states@#%^&*('renewed', 'signaled', 'U')	
where the defense is permitted under state law.@#%^&*('permitted', 'renewed', 'U')	
The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas@#%^&*('go', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and reducing the FSLIC's massive legal bills,@#%^&*('reducing', 'go', 'U')	('reducing', 'clearing', 'U')	('bills', 'topped', 'U')	
which topped $73 million last year.@#%^&*('topped', 'bills', 'U')	
The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases@#%^&*('encouraged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch,@#%^&*('brought', 'cases', 'U')	
best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team.@#%^&*('known', 'developers', 'U')	
Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch.@#%^&*('foreclosed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals@#%^&*('argued', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"that there will never be any assets@#%^&*('assets', 'argued', 'U')	
with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings@#%^&*('satisfy', 'assets', 'U')	
nor any means to collect from any other party,@#%^&*('means', 'argued', 'U')	
including FSLIC."@#%^&*('FSLIC', 'party', 'U')	
"If true,"@#%^&*('true', 'justify', 'U')	
the court wrote,@#%^&*('wrote', 'justify', 'U')	
"this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds."@#%^&*('justify', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the court said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC@#%^&*('it', 'sent', 'U')	('lacked', 'said', 'U')	
and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas.@#%^&*('sent', 'said', 'U')	('sent', 'lacked', 'U')	
Charles Haworth, a lawyer for Sunbelt, says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
he plans to file a brief this week@#%^&*('plans', 'says', 'U')	
urging the district judge to dismiss the suits,@#%^&*('urging', 'file', 'U')	
because Sunbelt's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $2 billion@#%^&*('exceeded', 'file', 'U')	
when federal regulators closed it in August 1988.@#%^&*('closed', 'exceeded', 'U')	
"This institution is just brain dead,"@#%^&*('dead', 'says', 'U')	
says Mr. Haworth, a partner in the Dallas office of Andrews & Kurth, a Houston law firm.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group, the developer of Valley Ranch, dismisses such arguments as a "defense du jour."@#%^&*('dismisses', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'judgment', 'U')	
a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award,@#%^&*('satisfied', 'says', 'U')	('the', 'reversal', 'U')	
including the reversal of Sunbelt's foreclosure on Valley Ranch.@#%^&*('reversal', 'ways', 'U')

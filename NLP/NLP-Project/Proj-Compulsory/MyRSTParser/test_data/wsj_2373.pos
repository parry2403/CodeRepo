In response to your overly optimistic, outdated piece@#%^&*IN	NN	TO	PRP$	RB	JJ	,	JJ	NN	
on how long unemployment lasts@#%^&*IN	WRB	JJ	NN	VBZ	
(People Patterns, Sept. 20):@#%^&*NNP	NNP	NN	,	NNP	CD	NNP	:	
I am in the communications field, above entry level.@#%^&*PRP	VBP	IN	DT	NNS	NN	,	IN	NN	NN	.	
I was laid off in August 1988,@#%^&*PRP	VBD	VBN	RP	IN	NNP	CD	,	
and after a thorough and exhausting job search, was hired in August 1989.@#%^&*CC	IN	DT	JJ	CC	JJ	NN	NN	,	VBD	VBN	IN	NNP	CD	.	
My unemployment insurance ran out@#%^&*PRP$	NN	NN	VBD	RP	
before I found a job;@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBD	DT	NN	:	
I found cutbacks and layoffs in many companies.@#%^&*PRP	VBD	NNS	CC	NNS	IN	JJ	NNS	.	
The statistics@#%^&*DT	NNS	
quoted by the "new" Census Bureau report@#%^&*VBN	IN	DT	``	JJ	''	NNP	NNP	NN	
(garnered from 1984 to 1986)@#%^&*NN	VBD	IN	CD	TO	CD	NN	
are out of date, certainly as an average for the Northeast, and possibly for the rest of the country.@#%^&*VBP	IN	IN	NN	,	RB	IN	DT	NN	IN	DT	NNP	,	CC	RB	IN	DT	NN	IN	DT	NN	.	
I think@#%^&*PRP	VBP	
what bothered me most about the piece was that there seemed to be an underlying attitude@#%^&*WP	VBD	PRP	JJS	IN	DT	NN	VBD	IN	EX	VBD	TO	VB	DT	JJ	NN	
to tell your readers@#%^&*TO	VB	PRP$	NNS	
all is well@#%^&*DT	VBZ	RB	
-- if you're getting laid off@#%^&*:	IN	PRP	VBP	VBG	VBD	RP	
don't worry,@#%^&*VBP	RB	VB	,	
and@#%^&*CC	
if you're unemployed,@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBP	JJ	,	
it's a seller's market.@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	DT	NN	POS	NN	.	
To top it off,@#%^&*TO	VB	PRP	RP	,	
you captioned the graph@#%^&*PRP	VBD	DT	NN	
showing the average number of months in a job search as "Time Off."@#%^&*VBG	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NNS	IN	DT	NN	NN	IN	``	NNP	IN	.	''	
Are you kidding?@#%^&*VBP	PRP	VBG	.	
Looking for a job was one of the most anxious periods of my life@#%^&*VBG	IN	DT	NN	VBD	CD	IN	DT	RBS	JJ	NNS	IN	PRP$	NN	
-- and is for most people.@#%^&*:	CC	VBZ	IN	JJS	NNS	.	
Your paper needs a serious reality check.@#%^&*PRP$	NN	VBZ	DT	JJ	NN	NN	.

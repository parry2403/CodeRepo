The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines@#%^&*DT	NNP	NNP	VBZ	VBN	JJ	JJ	NNS	
and clarified others in a move@#%^&*CC	VBN	NNS	IN	DT	NN	
that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants.@#%^&*WDT	MD	VB	DT	NN	IN	JJ	NN	NNS	IN	JJ	NNS	.	
The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements@#%^&*DT	RBS	JJ	NNS	IN	NN	NN	VBP	JJ	NNS	
that federal prosecutors avoid disrupting "the normal business functions" of companies@#%^&*IN	JJ	NNS	VB	VBG	``	DT	JJ	NN	NNS	''	IN	NNS	
charged under the racketeering law,@#%^&*VBN	IN	DT	NN	NN	,	
a senior department official said.@#%^&*DT	JJ	NN	NN	VBD	.	
Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline@#%^&*DT	JJ	NN	IN	NN	NN	VBZ	DT	JJ	NN	
warning prosecutors "not to take steps@#%^&*VBG	NNS	``	RB	TO	VB	NNS	
that would harm innocent third parties" in a case@#%^&*WDT	MD	VB	JJ	JJ	NNS	''	IN	DT	NN	
brought under the racketeering law,@#%^&*VBN	IN	DT	NN	NN	,	
the official, David Runkel, said.@#%^&*DT	NN	,	NNP	NNP	,	VBD	.	
The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process@#%^&*DT	NN	VBD	DT	NNS	CC	NNS	TO	NNP	NNS	IN	DT	NN	DT	NN	IN	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	
of updating prosecutorial guidelines,@#%^&*IN	VBG	JJ	NNS	,	
Mr. Runkel said.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	.	
The changes apply to prosecutions@#%^&*DT	NNS	VBP	TO	NNS	
brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law.@#%^&*VBN	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	CC	NNP	NNP	NN	.	
Under that law, defendants@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	,	NNS	
who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a "criminal enterprise"@#%^&*WP	RB	VBP	DT	NN	IN	NNS	IN	NNS	IN	DT	``	JJ	NN	''	
may be charged with racketeering@#%^&*MD	VB	VBN	IN	NN	
and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise.@#%^&*CC	VBN	TO	VB	DT	NNS	IN	DT	NN	.	
The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers.@#%^&*DT	NNP	NN	VBZ	VBN	IN	NN	IN	DT	NNS	CC	NN	NNS	.	
They argue@#%^&*PRP	VBP	
that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	IN	NNP	NNS	CC	JJ	NNS	
not named in RICO indictments@#%^&*RB	VBN	IN	NNP	NNS	
have been unfairly damaged.@#%^&*VBP	VBN	RB	VBN	.	
The department's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors@#%^&*DT	NN	VBZ	RBS	JJ	NN	IN	VBG	NNP	NN	VBZ	DT	NN	TO	NNS	
that they should seek to seize assets from defendants "in proportion" to the nature of the alleged offense,@#%^&*IN	PRP	MD	VB	TO	VB	NNS	IN	NNS	``	IN	NN	''	TO	DT	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	,	
Mr. Runkel said.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	.	
"That means that@#%^&*``	DT	VBZ	IN	
if the offense deals with one part of the business,@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	NNS	IN	CD	NN	IN	DT	NN	,	
you don't attempt to seize the whole business;@#%^&*PRP	VBP	RB	VB	TO	VB	DT	JJ	NN	:	
you attempt to seize assets related to the crime,"@#%^&*PRP	VBP	TO	VB	NNS	VBN	TO	DT	NN	,	''	
he explained.@#%^&*PRP	VBD	.	
In general, the thrust of the department's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures@#%^&*IN	JJ	,	DT	NN	IN	DT	NN	POS	NN	VBZ	TO	VB	NNS	TO	VB	JJ	NN	NNS	
if there are less intrusive means@#%^&*IN	EX	VBP	RBR	JJ	NNS	
of protecting assets@#%^&*IN	VBG	NNS	
the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction,@#%^&*DT	NN	MD	RB	VB	JJ	TO	VB	IN	DT	NN	,	
Mr. Runkel said.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	.

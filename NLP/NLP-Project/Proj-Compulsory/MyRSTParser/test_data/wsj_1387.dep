Yet another political scandal is racking Japan.@#%^&*('racking', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But this time it's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party members.@#%^&*('hurting', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And@#%^&*('And', 'revealing', 'U')	
as it unfolds,@#%^&*('unfolds', 'revealing', 'U')	('it', 'revealing', 'U')	
it's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society.@#%^&*('revealing', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Already, ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands@#%^&*('Already', 'stalled', 'U')	('demands', 'stalled', 'U')	('demands', 'forced', 'U')	
that opposition members testify under oath in parliament@#%^&*('testify', 'demands', 'U')	
have stalled one budget committee session@#%^&*('stalled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month.@#%^&*('forced', 'stalled', 'U')	
But the scandal itself is so convoluted@#%^&*('convoluted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that ruling-party members are divided between those@#%^&*('divided', 'convoluted', 'U')	('those', 'want', 'U')	('those', 'pursue', 'U')	
who want to pursue the matter in hope@#%^&*('want', 'those', 'U')	
of undermining the opposition@#%^&*('undermining', 'hope', 'U')	
and those@#%^&*('those', 'divided', 'U')	('those', 'favor', 'U')	
who favor leaving well enough alone.@#%^&*('favor', 'those', 'U')	
"The opposition can be the most hurt@#%^&*('hurt', 'says', 'U')	
because everyone already figures@#%^&*('figures', 'hurt', 'U')	
the LDP is that kind of beast,"@#%^&*('kind', 'figures', 'U')	
says Shigezo Hayasaka, former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But,@#%^&*('But', 'tell', 'U')	
he adds,@#%^&*('adds', 'tell', 'U')	
"We can't tell@#%^&*('tell', 'ROOT', 'R')	
where it will go at all@#%^&*('go', 'tell', 'U')	
because we're still in the middle of it."@#%^&*("'re", 'go', 'U')	
This time, the scandal centers on donations@#%^&*('centers', 'ROOT', 'R')	
made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry.@#%^&*('made', 'donations', 'U')	
Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling.@#%^&*('form', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The donations so far appear to be small,@#%^&*('appear', 'ROOT', 'R')	
especially compared with the huge sums@#%^&*('especially', 'small', 'U')	('with', 'small', 'U')	('sums', 'small', 'U')	('sums', 'changed', 'U')	
that changed hands in the Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal@#%^&*('changed', 'sums', 'U')	('scandal', 'plagued', 'U')	
that plagued the ruling party last year.@#%^&*('plagued', 'scandal', 'U')	
But the implications could be great.@#%^&*('great', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Pachinko is slightly on the shady side,@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
often linked to the lower ranks of Japan's underworld@#%^&*('linked', 'is', 'U')	('linked', 'on', 'U')	
and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders.@#%^&*('at', 'on', 'U')	
Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions,@#%^&*('faced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and political donations may have been made with the intent@#%^&*('donations', 'bribe', 'U')	('made', 'faced', 'U')	
to bribe.@#%^&*('bribe', 'made', 'U')	
Also, about 60% of pachinko parlor owners are Korean,@#%^&*('Korean', 'ROOT', 'R')	
many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents' organizations,@#%^&*('ties', 'illegal', 'U')	
and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan.@#%^&*('donations', 'ties', 'U')	('donations', 'organizations', 'U')	('illegal', 'maintain', 'U')	
To many Japanese, pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory.@#%^&*('benign', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country.@#%^&*('blaze', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Devotees pass hours,@#%^&*('pass', 'ROOT', 'R')	
watching the lights blink@#%^&*('watching', 'pass', 'U')	
and listening to the metal balls ping,@#%^&*('listening', 'pass', 'U')	('listening', 'watching', 'U')	
as much to gamble@#%^&*('gamble', 'pass', 'U')	('as', 'get', 'U')	('to', 'get', 'U')	
as to get a little time@#%^&*('get', 'gamble', 'U')	('get', 'gamble', 'U')	('to', 'anonymous', 'U')	
to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts.@#%^&*('anonymous', 'time', 'U')	('thoughts', 'get', 'U')	
At 500 yen@#%^&*('yen', 'pastime', 'U')	
($3.60)@#%^&*('$', 'yen', 'U')	
for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime,@#%^&*('handful', 'yen', 'U')	('pachinko', 'been', 'U')	('pastime', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and has been@#%^&*('been', 'pastime', 'U')	
since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II.@#%^&*('took', 'been', 'U')	
But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen@#%^&*('created', 'ROOT', 'R')	
(almost $92 billion),@#%^&*('$', 'income', 'U')	
or nearly the size of Japan's vaunted automobile industry.@#%^&*('size', 'created', 'U')	('size', 'income', 'U')	
And@#%^&*('And', 'estimate', 'U')	
because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion,@#%^&*('is', 'estimate', 'U')	
some observers estimate@#%^&*('estimate', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen.@#%^&*('yen', 'estimate', 'U')	
If that money were being taxed,@#%^&*('taxed', 'bring', 'U')	
it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen.@#%^&*('bring', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In 1984, an attempt was made@#%^&*('attempt', 'crack', 'U')	('made', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions.@#%^&*('crack', 'made', 'U')	
Then, in 1988, a proposal@#%^&*('Then', 'fielded', 'U')	('1988', 'fielded', 'U')	('proposal', 'fielded', 'U')	
to keep better track of income@#%^&*('keep', 'proposal', 'U')	
by selling prepaid cards for pachinko@#%^&*('selling', 'keep', 'U')	
was fielded in parliament.@#%^&*('fielded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin:@#%^&*('split', 'ROOT', 'R')	
North Koreans oppose the plan@#%^&*('oppose', 'split', 'U')	
while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it@#%^&*('South', 'neutral', 'U')	('accept', 'oppose', 'U')	
or are neutral.@#%^&*('neutral', 'oppose', 'U')	('neutral', 'accept', 'U')	
In August, a conservative weekly magazine reported@#%^&*('reported', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members.@#%^&*('donated', 'reported', 'U')	
The magazine alleged@#%^&*('alleged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that@#%^&*('that', 'offering', 'U')	
in making the donations,@#%^&*('making', 'offering', 'U')	('the', 'industry', 'U')	
the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes@#%^&*('offering', 'alleged', 'U')	
to win support in the battle against prepaid cards,@#%^&*('win', 'offering', 'U')	
or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren.@#%^&*('laundering', 'alleged', 'U')	
The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report.@#%^&*('denied', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And at first, neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue.@#%^&*('wanted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the press kept it alive;@#%^&*('kept', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as with the Recruit scandal, lists began circulating with names of people@#%^&*('began', 'kept', 'U')	('people', 'received', 'U')	
who had received money.@#%^&*('received', 'people', 'U')	
Within a matter of weeks, less-conservative magazines reported@#%^&*('reported', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations.@#%^&*('received', 'reported', 'U')	
So far, though, there have been no allegations@#%^&*('allegations', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the contributions@#%^&*('that', 'amounted', 'U')	('contributions', 'amounted', 'U')	('the', 'members', 'U')	
the LDP members received@#%^&*('received', 'contributions', 'U')	
amounted to bribes.@#%^&*('amounted', 'allegations', 'U')	
Then the two camps upped the ante:@#%^&*('upped', 'ROOT', 'R')	('ante', 'countered', 'U')	
Reports@#%^&*('Reports', 'ante', 'U')	
that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members@#%^&*('donated', 'Reports', 'U')	
were rapidly countered by statements@#%^&*('countered', 'upped', 'U')	
that the South Korean residents' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members.@#%^&*('donating', 'countered', 'U')	
The JSP admitted Oct. 13@#%^&*('admitted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization,@#%^&*('members', 'charged', 'U')	('received', 'admitted', 'U')	
and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen@#%^&*('charged', 'admitted', 'U')	('charged', 'received', 'U')	
($880,000)@#%^&*('$', 'yen', 'U')	
and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen.@#%^&*('parties', 'receiving', 'U')	('taking', 'receiving', 'U')	
On Friday, the chief cabinet secretary announced@#%^&*('announced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry,@#%^&*('received', 'announced', 'U')	
including 450,000 yen@#%^&*('yen', 'received', 'U')	
($3,175)@#%^&*('$', 'yen', 'U')	
by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.@#%^&*('Kaifu', 'yen', 'U')	
No one has alleged@#%^&*('alleged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the donations were by themselves illegal.@#%^&*('illegal', 'alleged', 'U')	
Direct donations from either of the residents' organizations would be illegal@#%^&*('illegal', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because the groups are defined as foreign,@#%^&*('defined', 'illegal', 'U')	
but both groups deny making direct donations.@#%^&*('deny', 'illegal', 'U')	
They say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
its possible some of their members may be donating privately.@#%^&*('possible', 'say', 'U')	
The issue is further complicated@#%^&*('complicated', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because@#%^&*('because', 'born', 'U')	
although the organizations represent Korean residents,@#%^&*('represent', 'born', 'U')	
those residents were largely born and raised in Japan@#%^&*('born', 'complicated', 'U')	('raised', 'complicated', 'U')	
and many speak only Japanese.@#%^&*('speak', 'complicated', 'U')	('speak', 'born', 'U')	
That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history@#%^&*('reflection', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades@#%^&*('shipped', 'reflection', 'U')	('decades', 'occupied', 'U')	
when Japan occupied Korea before World War II --@#%^&*('occupied', 'decades', 'U')	
and the discrimination@#%^&*('discrimination', 'reflection', 'U')	('discrimination', 'faces', 'U')	
that still faces Koreans in Japanese society.@#%^&*('faces', 'discrimination', 'U')	
Many Japanese think it only natural@#%^&*('think', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians, the way@#%^&*('donate', 'think', 'U')	
many Japanese do,@#%^&*('do', 'way', 'U')	
to win favor or support.@#%^&*('win', 'donate', 'U')	
Both residents' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad.@#%^&*('admit', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP's alleged donations,@#%^&*('tend', 'ROOT', 'R')	
implying@#%^&*('implying', 'speak', 'U')	
that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean@#%^&*('suspect', 'implying', 'U')	
because North Korea is communist@#%^&*('communist', 'suspect', 'U')	
and South Korea is an ally.@#%^&*('ally', 'suspect', 'U')	('ally', 'communist', 'U')

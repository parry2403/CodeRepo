October employment data@#%^&*NNP	NN	NNS	
-- also could turn out to be the most confusing.@#%^&*:	RB	MD	VB	RP	TO	VB	DT	RBS	JJ	.	
On the surface, the overall unemployment rate is expected to be little changed from September's 5.3%.@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	,	DT	JJ	NN	NN	VBZ	VBN	TO	VB	RB	VBN	IN	NNP	POS	CD	NN	.	
But the actual head count of non-farm employment payroll jobs is likely to be muddied by the impact of Hurricane Hugo, strikes, and less-than-perfect seasonal adjustments,@#%^&*CC	DT	JJ	NN	NN	IN	JJ	NN	NN	NNS	VBZ	JJ	TO	VB	VBN	IN	DT	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	,	NNS	,	CC	JJ	JJ	NNS	,	
economists said.@#%^&*NNS	VBD	.	
The consensus view calls for an overall job gain of 155,000@#%^&*DT	NN	NN	VBZ	IN	DT	JJ	NN	NN	IN	CD	
compared with September's 209,000 increase.@#%^&*VBN	IN	NNP	POS	CD	NN	.	
But the important factory-jobs segment,@#%^&*CC	DT	JJ	NNS	NN	,	
which last month plunged by 103,000 positions@#%^&*WDT	JJ	NN	VBD	IN	CD	NNS	
and raised recession fears,@#%^&*CC	VBN	NN	NNS	,	
is most likely to be skewed by the month's unusual events.@#%^&*VBZ	RBS	JJ	TO	VB	VBN	IN	DT	NN	POS	JJ	NNS	.	
Several other reports come before Friday's jobs data,@#%^&*JJ	JJ	NNS	VBP	IN	NNP	POS	NNS	NNS	,	
including: the September leading indicators index, new-home sales and October agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow; the October purchasing managers' index and September construction spending and manufacturers' orders on Wednesday; and October chain-store sales on Thursday.@#%^&*VBG	:	DT	NNP	VBG	NNS	NN	,	JJ	NNS	CC	NNP	JJ	NNS	NNS	JJ	IN	NN	:	DT	NNP	NN	NNS	POS	NN	CC	NNP	NN	NN	CC	NNS	POS	NNS	IN	NNP	:	CC	NNP	JJ	NNS	IN	NNP	.	
Friday brings the final count on October auto sales.@#%^&*NNP	VBZ	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	NN	NNS	.	
"The employment report is going to be difficult to interpret,"@#%^&*``	DT	NN	NN	VBZ	VBG	TO	VB	JJ	TO	VB	,	''	
said Michael Englund, economist with MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York.@#%^&*VBD	NNP	NNP	,	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	,	DT	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	,	NNP	NNP	.	
Mr. Englund added@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	
that next month's data isn't likely to be much better,@#%^&*IN	JJ	NN	POS	NNS	VBZ	RB	JJ	TO	VB	RB	JJR	,	
because it will be distorted by San Francisco's earthquake.@#%^&*IN	PRP	MD	VB	VBN	IN	NNP	NNP	POS	NN	.	
What's more,@#%^&*WP	VBZ	JJR	,	
he believes@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	
seasonal swings in the auto industry this year aren't occurring at the same time as in the past,@#%^&*JJ	NNS	IN	DT	NN	NN	DT	NN	VBP	RB	VBG	IN	DT	JJ	NN	IN	IN	DT	NN	,	
because of production and pricing differences@#%^&*IN	IN	NN	CC	NN	NNS	
that are curbing the accuracy of seasonal adjustments@#%^&*WDT	VBP	VBG	DT	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	
built into the employment data.@#%^&*VBN	IN	DT	NN	NNS	.	
Wednesday's report from the purchasing agents will be watched@#%^&*NNP	POS	NN	IN	DT	VBG	NNS	MD	VB	VBN	
to see if the index maintains a level below 50%,@#%^&*TO	VB	IN	DT	NN	VBZ	DT	NN	IN	CD	NN	,	
as it has for the past couple of months.@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBZ	IN	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NNS	.	
A reading of less than 50% indicates an economy@#%^&*DT	NN	IN	JJR	IN	CD	NN	VBZ	DT	NN	
that is generally contracting@#%^&*DT	VBZ	RB	VBG	
while a reading above 50% indicates an economy@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	IN	CD	NN	VBZ	DT	NN	
that's expanding.@#%^&*DT	VBZ	VBG	.	
Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc., Chicago, said@#%^&*NNP	NNP	NNP	,	JJ	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	,	NNP	,	VBD	
that the purchasers' report is valuable@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	POS	NN	VBZ	JJ	
because it often presents the first inkling of economic data for the month.@#%^&*IN	PRP	RB	VBZ	DT	JJ	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	IN	DT	NN	.	
But he added:@#%^&*CC	PRP	VBD	:	
"Some people use the purchasers' index as a leading indicator,@#%^&*``	DT	NNS	VBP	DT	NNS	POS	NN	IN	DT	VBG	NN	,	
some use it as a coincident indicator.@#%^&*DT	VBP	PRP	IN	DT	JJ	NN	.	
But the thing it's supposed to measure@#%^&*CC	DT	NN	PRP	VBZ	VBN	TO	VB	
-- manufacturing strength --@#%^&*:	VBG	NN	:	
it missed altogether last month."@#%^&*PRP	VBD	RB	JJ	NN	.	''	
David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., Boston, said@#%^&*NNP	NNP	,	JJ	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	,	NNP	,	VBD	
that the purchasers' index "does miss occasionally,"@#%^&*IN	DT	NNS	POS	NN	``	VBZ	VB	RB	,	''	
adding:@#%^&*VBG	:	
"When it misses one month@#%^&*``	WRB	PRP	VBZ	CD	NN	
it tends to miss the next month, too."@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	TO	VB	DT	JJ	NN	,	RB	.	''	
The consensus view on September leading indicators calls for a gain of 0.3%, the same as in August.@#%^&*DT	NN	NN	IN	NNP	VBG	NNS	VBZ	IN	DT	NN	IN	CD	NN	,	DT	JJ	IN	IN	NNP	.	
Economists said@#%^&*NNS	VBD	
greatly increased consumer optimism, a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index.@#%^&*RB	VBN	NN	NN	,	DT	JJR	NN	NN	CC	JJR	NN	NNS	VBD	VB	DT	NN	.	
All orders-related components, such as consumer-goods orders and building permits, are thought to have been weaker.@#%^&*DT	JJ	NNS	,	JJ	IN	NNS	NNS	CC	NN	NNS	,	VBP	VBN	TO	VB	VBN	JJR	.	
Data Resources' Mr. Wyss added@#%^&*NNP	NNP	POS	NNP	NNP	VBD	
that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on October chain-store sales.@#%^&*IN	PRP	MD	VB	VBG	DT	JJR	NN	IN	JJ	IN	NNP	JJ	NNS	.	
Usually, October "isn't a very interesting month {for retail figures}@#%^&*RB	,	NNP	``	VBZ	RB	DT	RB	JJ	NN	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	NN

he said.@#%^&*PRP	VBD	.	
But Mr. Wyss said@#%^&*CC	NNP	NNP	VBD	
he will watch the numbers@#%^&*PRP	MD	VB	DT	NNS	
to get an inkling@#%^&*TO	VB	DT	NN	
of whether consumers' general buying habits may slack off as much@#%^&*IN	IN	NNS	POS	JJ	NN	NNS	MD	VB	RP	RB	RB	
as their auto-buying apparently has.@#%^&*IN	PRP$	NN	RB	VBZ	.	
He noted@#%^&*PRP	VBD	
that higher gasoline prices will help buoy the October totals.@#%^&*IN	JJR	NN	NNS	MD	VB	VB	DT	NNP	NNS	.	
Seasonal factors are also expected to have taken their toll on September new-home sales,@#%^&*JJ	NNS	VBP	RB	VBN	TO	VB	VBN	PRP$	NN	IN	NNP	JJ	NNS	,	
which are believed to have fallen sharply from August's 755,000 units.@#%^&*WDT	VBP	VBN	TO	VB	VBN	RB	IN	NNP	POS	CD	NNS	.	
Construction spending is believed to have slipped about 0.5% from August levels,@#%^&*NN	NN	VBZ	VBN	TO	VB	VBN	RB	CD	NN	IN	NNP	NNS	,	
although economists noted@#%^&*IN	NNS	VBD

After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have changed considerably.@#%^&*IN	CD	NNS	,	DT	NNS	IN	DT	NN	NN	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	CC	PRP$	NN	NN	,	NNP	NNP	NNP	,	VBP	VBN	RB	.	
The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street@#%^&*DT	JJ	CD	NNP	NNS	VBD	VBN	RB	IN	NNP	NNP	
because they were considered to be important tests of the government's ability@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBD	VBN	TO	VB	JJ	NNS	IN	DT	NN	POS	NN	
to convince a jury of allegations@#%^&*TO	VB	DT	NN	IN	NNS	
stemming from its insider-trading investigations.@#%^&*VBG	IN	PRP$	JJ	NNS	.	
In an eight-count indictment, the government charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., chemical maker, and Mr. Sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986.@#%^&*IN	DT	JJ	NN	,	DT	NN	VBD	NNP	,	DT	NNP	,	NNP	,	NN	NN	,	CC	NNP	NNP	IN	RB	VBG	TO	VB	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	IN	NN	IN	NNP	POS	JJ	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	IN	DT	NN	IN	CD	.	
The government's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness, Boyd L. Jefferies, the former Los Angeles brokerage chief@#%^&*DT	NN	POS	NN	IN	DT	NNP	NN	VBD	RB	IN	PRP$	NN	NN	,	NNP	NNP	NNP	,	DT	JJ	NNP	NNP	NN	NN

The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian.@#%^&*DT	NNP	NNS	VBD	VBN	IN	NNS	IN	DT	NN	POS	NN	IN	PRP$	NNS	IN	NNP	NNP	CC	NNP	NNP	.	
Mr. Jefferies's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing.@#%^&*NNP	NNP	POS	NN	IN	DT	NN	VBD	VBN	TO	VB	PRP$	NN	.	
But GAF's bellwether role was short-lived.@#%^&*CC	NNP	POS	JJ	NN	VBD	JJ	.	
The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks@#%^&*DT	JJ	NNP	NN	VBD	IN	DT	NN	IN	CD	NNS	
when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found@#%^&*WRB	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	NNP	VBD	
that a prosecutor improperly, but unintentionally, withheld a document.@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	RB	,	CC	RB	,	VBD	DT	NN	.	
After 93 hours of deliberation, the jurors in the second trial said@#%^&*IN	CD	NNS	IN	NN	,	DT	NNS	IN	DT	JJ	NN	VBD	
they were hopelessly deadlocked,@#%^&*PRP	VBD	RB	VBN	,	
and another mistrial was declared on March 22.@#%^&*CC	DT	NN	VBD	VBN	IN	NNP	CD	.	
Meanwhile, a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June.@#%^&*RB	,	DT	JJ	NN	VBD	NNP	NNP	JJ	IN	NNS	NN	CC	JJ	NNS	IN	NNP	.	
A month later, Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge@#%^&*DT	NN	RB	,	NNP	NNP	VBD	VBN	DT	NN	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	
who praised him@#%^&*WP	VBD	PRP

In August, Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts.@#%^&*IN	NNP	,	NNP	NNP	VBD	JJ	TO	CD	NN	NNS	.	
Nevertheless, the stakes are still high for the players@#%^&*RB	,	DT	NNS	VBP	RB	JJ	IN	DT	NNS	
directly involved in the GAF case.@#%^&*RB	VBN	IN	DT	NNP	NN	.

For Mr. Sherwin, a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count.@#%^&*IN	NNP	NNP	,	DT	NN	MD	VB	NNS	IN	CD	NNS	IN	NN	CC	DT	$	CD	NN	IN	DT	NN	.

Individuals familiar with the case said@#%^&*NNS	JJ	IN	DT	NN	VBD

but by the end of the month the talks had ended.@#%^&*CC	IN	DT	NN	IN	DT	NN	DT	NNS	VBD	VBN	.	
There is much speculation among attorneys@#%^&*EX	VBZ	JJ	NN	IN	NNS

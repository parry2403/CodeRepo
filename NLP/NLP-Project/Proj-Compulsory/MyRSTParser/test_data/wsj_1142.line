and closed down 1.2%.@#%^&*1
The effects on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market makers,@#%^&*2
who watched the Nasdaq Composite Index tumble in sympathy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average,@#%^&*2
and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally.@#%^&*2

the composite rebounded a little,@#%^&*3
but finished down 5.52, at 461.70.@#%^&*3
In contrast, the industrial average recovered almost completely from its skid@#%^&*4
and closed down 0.1%.@#%^&*4
The New York Stock Exchange Composite was 0.4% lower for the day.@#%^&*5
As usual, the over-the-counter market's biggest technology stocks were hardest hit.@#%^&*6
Microsoft,@#%^&*7
battered by profit taking in recent sessions,@#%^&*7
sank as much as 4;@#%^&*7

"The market started with several strikes against it,"@#%^&*12
said Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton,@#%^&*12
referring to news@#%^&*12
that the labor-management buy-out of UAL Corp. continued to unravel,@#%^&*12
and reports@#%^&*12
that the junk-bond market is disintegrating.@#%^&*12
But the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter market,@#%^&*13
Mr. DaPuzzo said.@#%^&*13
Even though the over-the-counter market usually doesn't fall by as much as listed stocks during program-selling blitzes,@#%^&*14
he said,@#%^&*14
"when the market does recover,@#%^&*14
the damage is done@#%^&*14
and it leaves Nasdaq down more than the Big Board."@#%^&*14
Mr. DaPuzzo also complained@#%^&*15
that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors.@#%^&*15
While Shearson doesn't do computer-guided program trading for its own account,@#%^&*16
the firm does execute orders for clients@#%^&*16
involved in the buying and selling of shares@#%^&*16
tied to movements in certain stock indexes,@#%^&*16
Mr. DaPuzzo acknowledged.@#%^&*16
The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders, too.@#%^&*17
They don't like the risks@#%^&*18
they are forced to assume@#%^&*18
when prices swing so drastically.@#%^&*18
Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand@#%^&*19
to maintain orderly trading@#%^&*19
when imbalances occur.@#%^&*19
That means that on days@#%^&*20
when prices are tumbling@#%^&*20
and sellers abound@#%^&*20
they must be willing to buy shares from sellers@#%^&*20
when no one else will.@#%^&*20
In such an environment, a market maker can absorb huge losses.@#%^&*21
But the recent volatility in stock prices@#%^&*22
caused by the program trading@#%^&*22
has made some market makers less willing to soak up the stocks@#%^&*22
that are for sale.@#%^&*22
The market makers say@#%^&*23
they aren't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks@#%^&*23
because they realize@#%^&*23
prices can tumble quickly.@#%^&*23
The situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly,@#%^&*24
exacerbating the rise and fall in stock prices during program-dominated trading.@#%^&*24
Groused Robert Antolini, head of over-the-counter trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette:@#%^&*25

He said@#%^&*26

many traders believe@#%^&*26
that "there's no sense in sticking your nose out@#%^&*26
because you're an instant loser."@#%^&*26

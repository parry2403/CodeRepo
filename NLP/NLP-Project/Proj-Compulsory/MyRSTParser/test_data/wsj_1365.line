The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines@#%^&*1
and clarified others in a move@#%^&*1
that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants.@#%^&*1
The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements@#%^&*2
that federal prosecutors avoid disrupting "the normal business functions" of companies@#%^&*2
charged under the racketeering law,@#%^&*2
a senior department official said.@#%^&*2
Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline@#%^&*3
warning prosecutors "not to take steps@#%^&*3
that would harm innocent third parties" in a case@#%^&*3
brought under the racketeering law,@#%^&*3
the official, David Runkel, said.@#%^&*3
The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process@#%^&*4
of updating prosecutorial guidelines,@#%^&*4
Mr. Runkel said.@#%^&*4
The changes apply to prosecutions@#%^&*5
brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law.@#%^&*5
Under that law, defendants@#%^&*6
who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a "criminal enterprise"@#%^&*6
may be charged with racketeering@#%^&*6
and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise.@#%^&*6
The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers.@#%^&*7
They argue@#%^&*8
that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties@#%^&*8
not named in RICO indictments@#%^&*8
have been unfairly damaged.@#%^&*8
The department's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors@#%^&*9
that they should seek to seize assets from defendants "in proportion" to the nature of the alleged offense,@#%^&*9
Mr. Runkel said.@#%^&*9
"That means that@#%^&*10
if the offense deals with one part of the business,@#%^&*10
you don't attempt to seize the whole business;@#%^&*10
you attempt to seize assets related to the crime,"@#%^&*10
he explained.@#%^&*10
In general, the thrust of the department's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures@#%^&*11
if there are less intrusive means@#%^&*11
of protecting assets@#%^&*11
the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction,@#%^&*11
Mr. Runkel said.@#%^&*11

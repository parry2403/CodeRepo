GAF, Part III is scheduled to begin today.@#%^&*1
After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have changed considerably.@#%^&*2
The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street@#%^&*3
because they were considered to be important tests of the government's ability@#%^&*3
to convince a jury of allegations@#%^&*3
stemming from its insider-trading investigations.@#%^&*3
In an eight-count indictment, the government charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., chemical maker, and Mr. Sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986.@#%^&*4
The government's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness, Boyd L. Jefferies, the former Los Angeles brokerage chief@#%^&*5
who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky,@#%^&*5
and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin, takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian.@#%^&*5
The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian.@#%^&*6
Mr. Jefferies's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing.@#%^&*7
But GAF's bellwether role was short-lived.@#%^&*8
The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks@#%^&*9
when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found@#%^&*9
that a prosecutor improperly, but unintentionally, withheld a document.@#%^&*9
After 93 hours of deliberation, the jurors in the second trial said@#%^&*10
they were hopelessly deadlocked,@#%^&*10
and another mistrial was declared on March 22.@#%^&*10
Meanwhile, a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June.@#%^&*11
A month later, Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge@#%^&*12
who praised him@#%^&*12
for helping the government.@#%^&*12
In August, Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts.@#%^&*13
Nevertheless, the stakes are still high for the players@#%^&*14
directly involved in the GAF case.@#%^&*14
The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF, Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo.@#%^&*15
For Mr. Sherwin, a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count.@#%^&*16
GAF faces potential fines of $500,000 for each count.@#%^&*17
Individuals familiar with the case said@#%^&*18
that throughout September, defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort@#%^&*18
to prevent a trial,@#%^&*18
but by the end of the month the talks had ended.@#%^&*18
There is much speculation among attorneys@#%^&*19
not involved@#%^&*19
that the strategy of GAF's attorney, Arthur Liman, and Mr. Sherwin's counsel, Stephen Kaufman, will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman.@#%^&*19
Neither testified at the previous trials.@#%^&*20
For now, defense attorneys are tight-lipped about their plans.@#%^&*21
Max Gitter, another GAF defense attorney, said yesterday,@#%^&*22
"As we go in for the third time,@#%^&*22
Yogi Berra's famous line is apt:@#%^&*22
`It's deja vu all over again. '"@#%^&*22
DALKON SHIELD CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal.@#%^&*22
Attorneys for more than 18,000 women@#%^&*23
who claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device@#%^&*23
have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for A.H. Robins Co.,@#%^&*23
which manufactured the device.@#%^&*23
The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other.@#%^&*24
Baltimore attorney Michael A. Pretl and 17 other attorneys@#%^&*25
representing 18,136 claimants in the U.S. and abroad@#%^&*25
argue@#%^&*25
that the appeal would delay@#%^&*25
-- and perhaps even destroy --@#%^&*25
a $2.38 billion settlement fund@#%^&*25
that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan.@#%^&*25
The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants@#%^&*26
because it places a cap on the total amount of money available@#%^&*26
to settle claims.@#%^&*26
It also bars future suits against Robins company officials, members of the Robins family and Robins's former insurer, Aetna Life & Casualty Co.@#%^&*27
The latter provision is "legally unprecedented,"@#%^&*28
said Alan B. Morrison, a public interest lawyer in Washington, D.C.,@#%^&*28
who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants.@#%^&*28
More than 100,000 claims against Robins are pending.@#%^&*29
The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence@#%^&*30
that it could cause serious injuries.@#%^&*30
Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985;@#%^&*31
such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits@#%^&*31
while it works out a plan for paying its debts.@#%^&*31
American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins,@#%^&*32
but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted.@#%^&*32
In a brief@#%^&*33
filed with the Supreme Court last week,@#%^&*33
Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal@#%^&*33
for raising "abstract" and "theoretical" legal issues,@#%^&*33
while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants.@#%^&*33
The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3@#%^&*34
and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6.@#%^&*34
JURY`S CRIMINAL CONVICTION under Superfund law is a first.@#%^&*35
Charles A. Donohoo, sole proprieter of a Louisville, Ky., demolition company, was found guilty of violating the Superfund law as well as the Clean Air Act.@#%^&*36
Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare,@#%^&*37
and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case.@#%^&*37
Under Superfund, those@#%^&*38
who owned, generated or transported hazardous waste@#%^&*38
are liable for its cleanup,@#%^&*38
regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time.@#%^&*38
Environmental lawyers say@#%^&*39
virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties@#%^&*39
designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities.@#%^&*39
But Superfund also contains a criminal provision@#%^&*40
concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment.@#%^&*40
In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty@#%^&*41
by making it a felony.@#%^&*41
Mr. Donohoo was convicted in Louisville late last month of violating Superfund@#%^&*42
by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building@#%^&*42
he was demolishing.@#%^&*42
He was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building, a violation of the Clean Air Act.@#%^&*43
The government sought a criminal penalty@#%^&*44
because "no cleanup is possible here.@#%^&*44
Once {asbestos} is released into the environment,@#%^&*45
it can lodge anywhere,"@#%^&*45
says Richard A. Dennis, the assistant U.S. attorney@#%^&*45
who prosecuted the case.@#%^&*45
Mr. Donohoo is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 11.@#%^&*46
His lawyer could not be reached for comment.@#%^&*47
Mr. Donohoo faces as much as three years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the Superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $100,000 fine for the violation of the Clean Air Act.@#%^&*48
TED BUNDY'S LAWYERS switch to victims' side in death-sentence case.@#%^&*49
Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, the Washington, D.C., law firm@#%^&*50
that spent over $1 million@#%^&*50
fighting the execution of mass-murderer Ted Bundy@#%^&*50
-- who eventually was executed --@#%^&*50
has taken on another death penalty case before the Supreme Court, this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in Arkansas.@#%^&*50
The law firm has filed a friend-of-the-court brief jointly with the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group.@#%^&*51
The key issue in the case,@#%^&*52
which the law firm is handling without a fee, or pro bono,@#%^&*52
is whether a person@#%^&*52
sentenced to death@#%^&*52
can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review.@#%^&*52
The murderer, Ronald Gene Simmons, was convicted of killing 14 people.@#%^&*53
Another murderer on death row has appealed Mr. Simmons's death sentence in a "next friend" capacity.@#%^&*54
Wilmer Cutler's brief argues@#%^&*55
that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences@#%^&*55
and that the inmate@#%^&*55
who filed the appeal@#%^&*55
lacks proper standing.@#%^&*55
P.J. Mode, Wilmer Cutler's managing partner, says@#%^&*56
the trial team@#%^&*56
that represented Mr. Bundy@#%^&*56
was asked by the firm's pro bono committee@#%^&*56
whether the new case posed a conflict@#%^&*56
and that no objections were raised.@#%^&*56
The coupling of the law firm and the Washington Legal Foundation is odd also,@#%^&*57
because Wilmer Cutler was one of the firms@#%^&*57
singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group@#%^&*57
for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work.@#%^&*57
"We give them a lot of credit@#%^&*58
for taking this case,"@#%^&*58
says WLF's Alan Slobodin.@#%^&*58
THE CASE OF THE FAKE DALIS:@#%^&*59
In federal court in Manhattan, three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake Salvador Dali lithographs.@#%^&*59
James Burke and Larry Evans, formerly owners of the now-defunct Barclay Gallery, and Prudence Clark, a Barclay sales representative, were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales@#%^&*60
in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed, limited-edition lithographs.@#%^&*60
The posters were sold for $1,300 to $6,000,@#%^&*61
although the government says@#%^&*61
they had a value of only $53 to $200 apiece.@#%^&*61
Henry Pitman, the assistant U.S. attorney@#%^&*62
handling the case,@#%^&*62
said@#%^&*62
about 1,000 customers were defrauded@#%^&*62
and that Barclay's total proceeds from the sales were $3.4 million.@#%^&*62
Attorneys for Messrs. Burke and Evans and Ms. Clarke said@#%^&*63
that@#%^&*63
although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales,@#%^&*63
they had believed@#%^&*63
that the works were authorized by Mr. Dali,@#%^&*63
who died in January.@#%^&*63
The posters were printed on paper@#%^&*64
pre-signed by Mr. Dali,@#%^&*64
the attorneys said.@#%^&*64

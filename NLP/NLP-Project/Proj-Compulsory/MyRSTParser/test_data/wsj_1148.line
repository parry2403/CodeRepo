Mobil Corp. is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the U.S., possibly as soon as next month,@#%^&*1
say individuals familiar with the company's strategy.@#%^&*1
The size of the cuts isn't known,@#%^&*2
but they'll be centered in the exploration and production division,@#%^&*2
which is responsible for locating oil reserves, drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas.@#%^&*2
Employees haven't yet been notified.@#%^&*3
Sources said@#%^&*4
that meetings@#%^&*4
to discuss the staff reductions@#%^&*4
have been scheduled for Friday at Mobil offices in New Orleans and Denver.@#%^&*4
This would be a second round of cuts by Mobil,@#%^&*5
which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by 15% to 20% during the mid-1980s as part of an industrywide shakeout.@#%^&*5
Mobil's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil-producing operations.@#%^&*6
In yesterday's third-quarter earnings report, the company alluded to a $40 million provision for restructuring costs@#%^&*7
involving U.S. exploration and production operations.@#%^&*7
The report says@#%^&*8
that "the restructuring will take place over a two-year period@#%^&*8
and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our U.S. operations."@#%^&*8
A company spokesman,@#%^&*9
reached at his home last night,@#%^&*9
would only say@#%^&*9
that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week.@#%^&*9
Most oil companies,@#%^&*10
including Mobil,@#%^&*10
have been reporting lower third-quarter earnings, largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses.@#%^&*10
Individuals familiar with Mobil's strategy say@#%^&*11
that Mobil is reducing its U.S. work force@#%^&*11
because of declining U.S. output.@#%^&*11
Yesterday, Mobil said@#%^&*12
domestic exploration and production operations had a $16 million loss in the third quarter,@#%^&*12
while comparable foreign operations earned $234 million.@#%^&*12
Industrywide, oil production in this country fell by 500,000 barrels a day to 7.7 million barrels in the first eight months of this year.@#%^&*13
Daily output is expected to decline by at least another 500,000 barrels next year.@#%^&*14
Some Mobil executives were dismayed@#%^&*15
that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report@#%^&*15
before workers were notified.@#%^&*15
One Mobil executive said@#%^&*16
that the $40 million charge@#%^&*16
related to the action@#%^&*16
indicates@#%^&*16
"a substantial" number of people will be involved.@#%^&*16
Some will likely be offered severance packages@#%^&*17
while others will be transferred to overseas operations.@#%^&*17

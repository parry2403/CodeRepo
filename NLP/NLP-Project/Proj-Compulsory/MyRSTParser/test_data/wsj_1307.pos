In a startling turnabout, Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining@#%^&*IN	DT	JJ	NN	,	NNP	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	NNP	VBP	VBG	
that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them.@#%^&*IN	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	VBZ	VBG	IN	PRP	.	
David Boren, the Intelligence Committee chairman, is upset@#%^&*NNP	NNP	,	DT	NNP	NNP	NN	,	VBZ	VBN	
that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration@#%^&*IN	NN	VBD	DT	NN	TO	DT	NN	IN	DT	NNP	NN	
suggesting@#%^&*VBG	
that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup@#%^&*IN	DT	NNP	MD	VB	TO	VB	JJ	NN	NNP	NNP	IN	PRP	VBD	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	
that might result in his assassination.@#%^&*WDT	MD	VB	IN	PRP$	NN	.	
With due respect to "highly classified correspondence" and other buzzwords, the leakers are performing a public service.@#%^&*IN	JJ	NN	TO	``	RB	JJ	NN	''	CC	JJ	NNS	,	DT	NNS	VBP	VBG	DT	JJ	NN	.	
If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega,@#%^&*IN	DT	NNP	VBZ	VBN	DT	NN	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	,	
the American people ought to know.@#%^&*DT	JJ	NNS	MD	TO	VB	.	
What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry.@#%^&*WP	VBD	JJ	IN	NNP	VBZ	DT	JJ	NN	IN	JJ	CC	JJ	NN	.	
Naturally, Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein@#%^&*RB	,	NNP	NNP	CC	PRP$	NN	MD	VB	JJ	NN	
to blame the executive branch@#%^&*TO	VB	DT	JJ	NN	
while stamping "top secret" on their own complicity.@#%^&*IN	VBG	``	JJ	NN	''	IN	PRP$	JJ	NN	.	
But there's no danger@#%^&*CC	EX	VBZ	DT	NN	
of exposing sources and methods@#%^&*IN	VBG	NNS	CC	NNS	
in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue.@#%^&*IN	VBG	DT	NN	VBG	IN	CC	IN	NNP	NNP	.	
And@#%^&*CC	
if Congress is going to assume authority@#%^&*IN	NNP	VBZ	VBG	TO	VB	NN	
to micromanage foreign policy,@#%^&*TO	NN	JJ	NN	,	
it's going to have to take some of the responsibility too.@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	VBG	TO	VB	TO	VB	DT	IN	DT	NN	RB	.	
The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega.@#%^&*DT	NNP	IN	DT	NNP	NNPS	VBD	DT	JJ	JJ	NNS	TO	VB	IN	NNP	NNP	.	
When they did,@#%^&*WRB	PRP	VBD	,	
his commanders didn't have the initiative@#%^&*PRP$	NNS	VBD	RB	VB	DT	NN	
to do more than block a couple of roads.@#%^&*TO	VB	JJR	IN	VB	DT	NN	IN	NNS	.	
The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity.@#%^&*DT	JJ	NN	VBZ	DT	JJ	NN	IN	NN	.	
But what kind of initiative can you expect@#%^&*CC	WDT	NN	IN	NN	MD	PRP	VB	
given the climate set by Congress?@#%^&*VBN	DT	NN	VBN	IN	NNP	.	
For example, what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations?@#%^&*IN	NN	,	WP	RB	VBD	DT	NNP	VB	NNP	NNP	CC	PRP$	JJ	NN	NNS	IN	NNP	NNS	CC	NN	NNS	IN	NNS	.	
What part did U.S. warnings play in the major's unwillingness@#%^&*WDT	NN	VBD	NNP	NNS	VBP	IN	DT	NN	POS	NN	
to pull the trigger@#%^&*TO	VB	DT	NN	
when he had General Noriega in custody,@#%^&*WRB	PRP	VBD	NNP	NNP	IN	NN	,	
but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops?@#%^&*CC	VBD	IN	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	.	
Mr. Noriega didn't suffer from any hesitation@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	RB	VB	IN	DT	NN	
once he had the pistol.@#%^&*RB	PRP	VBD	DT	NN	.	
Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning:@#%^&*RB	PRP	VBP	DT	NNP	NN	IN	DT	NNP	NN	:	
You have the right@#%^&*PRP	VBP	DT	NN	
to conceal your coup intentions,@#%^&*TO	VB	PRP$	NN	NNS	,	
because we may rat on you.@#%^&*IN	PRP	MD	VB	IN	PRP	.	
Or maybe a Surgeon General's warning:@#%^&*CC	RB	DT	NNP	NNP	POS	NN	:	
Confiding in the United States may be fatal.@#%^&*VBG	IN	DT	NNP	NNPS	MD	VB	JJ	.	
CIA chief William Webster, hardly a Washington malcontent, got the debate started last week@#%^&*NNP	NN	NNP	NNP	,	RB	DT	NNP	NN	,	VBD	DT	NN	VBD	JJ	NN	
by noting@#%^&*IN	VBG	
that the executive order@#%^&*IN	DT	JJ	NN	
banning assassinations@#%^&*VBG	NNS	
had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup.@#%^&*VBD	VBN	TO	NNP	NN	IN	DT	NN	.	
The CIA's Deputy Director of Operations, Richard Stoltz, tried to smooth things over a few days later,@#%^&*DT	NNP	POS	NNP	NNP	IN	NNP	,	NNP	NNP	,	VBD	TO	VB	NNS	IN	DT	JJ	NNS	RB	,	
but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster's point.@#%^&*CC	RB	RB	VBD	NNP	NNP	POS	NN	.	
"The interpretation" of the executive order,@#%^&*``	DT	NN	''	IN	DT	JJ	NN	,	
Mr. Stoltz said,@#%^&*NNP	NNP	VBD	,	
"and the way@#%^&*``	CC	DT	NN	
in which the various committees have over time interpreted it,@#%^&*IN	WDT	DT	JJ	NNS	VBP	IN	NN	VBD	PRP	,	
has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators,@#%^&*VBZ	VBN	IN	PRP$	NN	TO	DT	JJ	NN	IN	DT	NN	IN	NNS	,	
including me."@#%^&*VBG	PRP	.	''	
In other words, Congress won't let the CIA do much of anything anymore,@#%^&*IN	JJ	NNS	,	NNP	MD	RB	VB	DT	NNP	VBP	JJ	IN	NN	RB	,	
and that's fine with the CIA.@#%^&*CC	DT	VBZ	JJ	IN	DT	NNP	.	
The pay's the same,@#%^&*DT	NN	VBZ	DT	JJ	,	
and the duty's lighter.@#%^&*CC	DT	NN	POS	JJR	.	
And of course, doing anything@#%^&*CC	IN	NN	,	VBG	NN	
that might be second-guessed by Congress@#%^&*DT	MD	VB	VBN	IN	NNP	
carries heavy penalties.@#%^&*VBZ	JJ	NNS	.	
Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North.@#%^&*VB	DT	NNP	NN	IN	NNP	NNP	.	
The Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Senator William Cohen, joined with Senator George Mitchell@#%^&*DT	NNP	NNP	POS	JJ	NNP	,	NNP	NNP	NNP	,	VBD	IN	NNP	NNP	NNP	
to write a best seller about Iran-Contra,@#%^&*TO	VB	DT	JJS	NN	IN	NNP	,	
deploring "Men of Zeal."@#%^&*VBG	``	NN	IN	NNP	.	''	
No doubt many people in the CIA, the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it.@#%^&*DT	NN	JJ	NNS	IN	DT	NNP	,	DT	NNP	CC	DT	NNP	NNP	NNP	VBP	VBN	PRP	.	
What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line@#%^&*WDT	NN	IN	NN	MD	NN	VB	IN	NNS	IN	IN	DT	NN	
who've read all this@#%^&*WP	VBP	VBN	PDT	DT	
and know what can happen@#%^&*CC	VB	WP	MD	VB	
if they fail?@#%^&*IN	PRP	VBP	.	
Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play?@#%^&*WP	VBZ	TO	VB	RP	IN	DT	NN	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	NN	VB	.	
The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set, a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action.@#%^&*DT	NN	IN	NNS	VBZ	DT	NN	IN	DT	JJ	JJ	NN	,	DT	NN	IN	DT	CD	NNP	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	.	
President Bush would do himself and the country a favor@#%^&*NNP	NNP	MD	VB	PRP	CC	DT	NN	DT	NN	
by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability@#%^&*IN	VBG	DT	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NN	IN	PRP$	NN	
to defend America's national security.@#%^&*TO	VB	NNP	POS	JJ	NN	.	
There are of course good reasons@#%^&*EX	VBP	IN	NN	JJ	NNS	
the U.S. shouldn't get into the assassination business,@#%^&*DT	NNP	MD	RB	VB	IN	DT	NN	NN	,	
but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing@#%^&*CC	VBG	DT	JJ	NN	VBZ	RB	DT	JJ	NN	
as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars.@#%^&*IN	VBG	DT	NNP	MD	VB	VBG	RP	VBG	NNS	.	
The world being the nasty place@#%^&*DT	NN	VBG	DT	JJ	NN	
it is,@#%^&*PRP	VBZ	,	
we want Presidents to have the freedom@#%^&*PRP	VBP	NNP	TO	VB	DT	NN	
to order operations@#%^&*TO	VB	NNS	
in which someone might get killed.@#%^&*IN	WDT	NN	MD	VB	VBN	.	
In such situations, you cannot write rules in advance,@#%^&*IN	JJ	NNS	,	PRP	MD	RB	VB	NNS	IN	NN	,	
you can only make sure@#%^&*PRP	MD	RB	VB	JJ	
the President takes the responsibility.@#%^&*DT	NNP	VBZ	DT	NN	.	
The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral.@#%^&*DT	JJ	NN	CC	DT	VBN	NNS	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	VBP	DT	JJ	CC	JJ	.	
As it now stands,@#%^&*IN	PRP	RB	VBZ	,	
the U.S. can bomb Tripoli,@#%^&*DT	NNP	MD	VB	NNP	,	
but can't "assassinate" Colonel Gadhafi.@#%^&*CC	MD	RB	``	VB	''	NNP	NNP	.	
It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley,@#%^&*PRP	MD	VB	DT	NN	NN	TO	VB	JJ	NNS	IN	DT	NNP	NNP	,	
but can't shoot Abu Nidal.@#%^&*CC	MD	RB	VB	NNP	NNP	.	
Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world@#%^&*CC	DT	NN	NN	CC	DT	NN	IN	NN	IN	NNP	VBP	VBG	DT	NN	
that the only way@#%^&*IN	DT	JJ	NN	
the U.S. will kill a madman@#%^&*DT	NNP	MD	VB	DT	NN

we take some innocent civilians with him.@#%^&*PRP	VBP	DT	JJ	NNS	IN	PRP	.

There are, however, some alternatives@#%^&*EX	VBP	,	RB	,	DT	NNS	
that income-oriented investors should consider,@#%^&*IN	JJ	NNS	MD	VB	,	
investment advisers say.@#%^&*NN	NNS	VBP	.	
Short-term municipal bonds, bond funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices@#%^&*JJ	JJ	NNS	,	NN	NNS	CC	JJ	NNS	VBP	DT	IN	DT	NNS

Here's a look at some of the alternatives:@#%^&*RB	VBZ	DT	NN	IN	DT	IN	DT	NNS	:	
SHORT-TERM MUNICIPALS:@#%^&*JJ	NNS	:	
Investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators.@#%^&*NNS	IN	DT	JJ	NN	NN	MD	VB	RP	PRP$	NNS	.

That's because municipal-bond interest is exempt from federal income tax@#%^&*DT	VBZ	IN	JJ	NN	VBZ	JJ	IN	JJ	NN	NN	
-- and from state and local taxes too, for in-state investors.@#%^&*:	CC	IN	NN	CC	JJ	NNS	RB	,	IN	JJ	NNS	.	
For an investor@#%^&*IN	DT	NN	
paying tax at a 33% rate,@#%^&*VBG	NN	IN	DT	CD	NN	NN	,	
a seemingly puny 6% yield on a one-year muni is equivalent to a taxable 9%.@#%^&*DT	RB	JJ	CD	NN	NN	IN	DT	JJ	NNS	VBZ	JJ	TO	DT	JJ	CD	NN	.	
Rates approach 6.5% on five-year municipals.@#%^&*NNS	VBP	CD	NN	IN	JJ	NNS	.	
Some of the more cautious CD holders might like "pre-refunded" municipals.@#%^&*DT	IN	DT	RBR	JJ	NNP	NNS	MD	VB	``	JJ	''	NNS	.

The idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates.@#%^&*DT	NN	VBZ	TO	VB	NN	VBG	IN	DT	NN	IN	VBG	NN	NNS	.	
BOND FUNDS:@#%^&*NN	NNS	:

Buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns@#%^&*NNS	MD	VB	RB	TO	JJ	JJ	NNS

The price movements get bigger@#%^&*DT	NN	NNS	VBP	JJR

Consider, for instance, two bond funds from Vanguard Group of Investment Cos.@#%^&*VB	,	IN	NN	,	CD	NN	NNS	IN	NNP	NNP	IN	NNP	NNP	.

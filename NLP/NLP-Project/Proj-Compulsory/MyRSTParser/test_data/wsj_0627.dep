October employment data@#%^&*('data', 'turn', 'U')	('data', 'confusing', 'U')	
-- also could turn out to be the most confusing.@#%^&*('turn', 'ROOT', 'R')	
On the surface, the overall unemployment rate is expected to be little changed from September's 5.3%.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the actual head count of non-farm employment payroll jobs is likely to be muddied by the impact of Hurricane Hugo, strikes, and less-than-perfect seasonal adjustments,@#%^&*('likely', 'said', 'U')	
economists said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The consensus view calls for an overall job gain of 155,000@#%^&*('calls', 'ROOT', 'R')	
compared with September's 209,000 increase.@#%^&*('with', 'calls', 'U')	('increase', 'calls', 'U')	
But the important factory-jobs segment,@#%^&*('But', 'likely', 'U')	('segment', 'plunged', 'U')	('segment', 'likely', 'U')	('segment', 'skewed', 'U')	
which last month plunged by 103,000 positions@#%^&*('month', 'raised', 'U')	('plunged', 'segment', 'U')	
and raised recession fears,@#%^&*('raised', 'segment', 'U')	('raised', 'plunged', 'U')	('is', 'likely', 'U')	
is most likely to be skewed by the month's unusual events.@#%^&*('likely', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Several other reports come before Friday's jobs data,@#%^&*('come', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'index', 'U')	
including: the September leading indicators index, new-home sales and October agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow; the October purchasing managers' index and September construction spending and manufacturers' orders on Wednesday; and October chain-store sales on Thursday.@#%^&*('index', 'come', 'U')	('reports', 'come', 'U')	('index', 'come', 'U')	('sales', 'come', 'U')	
Friday brings the final count on October auto sales.@#%^&*('brings', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"The employment report is going to be difficult to interpret,"@#%^&*('going', 'said', 'U')	
said Michael Englund, economist with MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Englund added@#%^&*('added', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that next month's data isn't likely to be much better,@#%^&*('likely', 'added', 'U')	
because it will be distorted by San Francisco's earthquake.@#%^&*('distorted', 'better', 'U')	
What's more,@#%^&*('more', 'believes', 'U')	
he believes@#%^&*('believes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
seasonal swings in the auto industry this year aren't occurring at the same time as in the past,@#%^&*('occurring', 'believes', 'U')	
because of production and pricing differences@#%^&*('differences', 'occurring', 'U')	('differences', 'curbing', 'U')	
that are curbing the accuracy of seasonal adjustments@#%^&*('curbing', 'differences', 'U')	
built into the employment data.@#%^&*('built', 'adjustments', 'U')	
Wednesday's report from the purchasing agents will be watched@#%^&*('report', 'see', 'U')	('watched', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to see if the index maintains a level below 50%,@#%^&*('see', 'watched', 'U')	
as it has for the past couple of months.@#%^&*('for', 'maintains', 'U')	
A reading of less than 50% indicates an economy@#%^&*('indicates', 'ROOT', 'R')	('economy', 'contracting', 'U')	
that is generally contracting@#%^&*('contracting', 'economy', 'U')	
while a reading above 50% indicates an economy@#%^&*('indicates', 'contracting', 'U')	('economy', 'expanding', 'U')	
that's expanding.@#%^&*('expanding', 'economy', 'U')	
Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc., Chicago, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the purchasers' report is valuable@#%^&*('valuable', 'said', 'U')	
because it often presents the first inkling of economic data for the month.@#%^&*('presents', 'valuable', 'U')	
But he added:@#%^&*('added', 'use', 'U')	
"Some people use the purchasers' index as a leading indicator,@#%^&*('use', 'added', 'U')	
some use it as a coincident indicator.@#%^&*('use', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the thing it's supposed to measure@#%^&*('But', 'missed', 'U')	('thing', 'missed', 'U')	
-- manufacturing strength --@#%^&*('strength', 'thing', 'U')	
it missed altogether last month."@#%^&*('missed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., Boston, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the purchasers' index "does miss occasionally,"@#%^&*('miss', 'said', 'U')	
adding:@#%^&*('adding', 'said', 'U')	
"When it misses one month@#%^&*('misses', 'tends', 'U')	('it', 'tends', 'U')	
it tends to miss the next month, too."@#%^&*('tends', 'adding', 'U')	
The consensus view on September leading indicators calls for a gain of 0.3%, the same as in August.@#%^&*('calls', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Economists said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
greatly increased consumer optimism, a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index.@#%^&*('greatly', 'said', 'U')	('helped', 'said', 'U')	
All orders-related components, such as consumer-goods orders and building permits, are thought to have been weaker.@#%^&*('thought', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Data Resources' Mr. Wyss added@#%^&*('added', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on October chain-store sales.@#%^&*('keeping', 'added', 'U')	
Usually, October "isn't a very interesting month {for retail figures}@#%^&*('month', 'said', 'U')	
because school clothes have been bought@#%^&*('bought', 'month', 'U')	
and people are waiting for December@#%^&*('people', 'buy', 'U')	('waiting', 'month', 'U')	('waiting', 'bought', 'U')	
to buy Christmas presents,"@#%^&*('buy', 'waiting', 'U')	
he said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But Mr. Wyss said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
he will watch the numbers@#%^&*('watch', 'said', 'U')	('numbers', 'get', 'U')	
to get an inkling@#%^&*('get', 'watch', 'U')	
of whether consumers' general buying habits may slack off as much@#%^&*('slack', 'inkling', 'U')	('as', 'has', 'U')	
as their auto-buying apparently has.@#%^&*('has', 'much', 'U')	('has', 'much', 'U')	
He noted@#%^&*('noted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that higher gasoline prices will help buoy the October totals.@#%^&*('help', 'noted', 'U')	
Seasonal factors are also expected to have taken their toll on September new-home sales,@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	('sales', 'believed', 'U')	('sales', 'fallen', 'U')	('are', 'believed', 'U')	
which are believed to have fallen sharply from August's 755,000 units.@#%^&*('believed', 'sales', 'U')	
Construction spending is believed to have slipped about 0.5% from August levels,@#%^&*('believed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
although economists noted@#%^&*('noted', 'slipped', 'U')	
the rate probably will pick up in the months ahead in response to hurricane and earthquake damage.@#%^&*('pick', 'noted', 'U')

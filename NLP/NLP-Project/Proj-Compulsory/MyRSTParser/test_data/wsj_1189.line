Savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often@#%^&*1
as they reject whites,@#%^&*1
the Office of Thrift Supervision said.@#%^&*1
But that doesn't necessarily mean thrifts are discriminating against blacks,@#%^&*2
the agency said.@#%^&*2
The office, an arm of the Treasury, said@#%^&*3
it doesn't have data on the financial position of applicants@#%^&*3
and thus can't determine@#%^&*3
why blacks are rejected more often.@#%^&*3
Nevertheless, on Capitol Hill,@#%^&*4
where the information was released yesterday at a Senate banking subcommittee hearing,@#%^&*4
lawmakers said@#%^&*4
they are worried@#%^&*4
that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities.@#%^&*4
They asked regulators to suggest new ways@#%^&*5
to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti-discrimination laws.@#%^&*5
Sen. Alan Dixon@#%^&*6
(D, Ill.),@#%^&*6
chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs, said,@#%^&*6
"I'm not a statistician.@#%^&*6
But@#%^&*7
when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites@#%^&*7
-- and in some cities, it is three and four times as often --@#%^&*7
I conclude@#%^&*7
that discrimination is part of the problem."@#%^&*7
James Grohl, a spokesman for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, said,@#%^&*8
"The data is a red flag,@#%^&*8
but@#%^&*8
lacking the financial data@#%^&*8
you can't make a case@#%^&*8
that discrimination is widespread."@#%^&*8
The trade group official added:@#%^&*9
"Certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it."@#%^&*9
Sen. Dixon held the hearing@#%^&*10
to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill@#%^&*10
that required regulators to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending.@#%^&*10
The legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race, sex and income level of borrowers,@#%^&*11
but that information won't be gathered in new studies for several months at least.@#%^&*11
The Federal Reserve said@#%^&*12
its studies in recent years,@#%^&*12
which adjust for income differences and other variables,@#%^&*12
showed@#%^&*12
that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites.@#%^&*12
But John LaWare, a Fed governor, told the subcommittee@#%^&*13
the evidence is mixed@#%^&*13
and that the Fed's believes@#%^&*13
the vast majority of banks aren't discriminating.@#%^&*13
For instance,@#%^&*14
he noted,@#%^&*14
the Fed studies have shown@#%^&*14
that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites.@#%^&*14
Several lawmakers were angered@#%^&*15
that the bank and thrift regulators generally said@#%^&*15
they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years@#%^&*15
to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination.@#%^&*15
"We would be the first to admit@#%^&*16
that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years"@#%^&*16
to developing examinations for discrimination,@#%^&*16
said Jonathan Fiechter, a top official of the Office of Thrift Supervision.@#%^&*16
"If we've got folks out there@#%^&*17
who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly,"@#%^&*17
said Sen. Donald Riegle@#%^&*17
(D., Mich.),@#%^&*17
chairman of the banking committee,@#%^&*17
"then that is a matter@#%^&*17
that needs remedy now, not six months from now, or six years from now, or 26 years from now."@#%^&*17
Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said@#%^&*18
they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws.@#%^&*18
The FDIC said@#%^&*19
it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices.@#%^&*19
The comptroller's office said@#%^&*20
it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987.@#%^&*20
The comptroller's office also said@#%^&*21
that of 37,000 complaints@#%^&*21
it received since January 1987,@#%^&*21
only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending.@#%^&*21
The agency investigated the complaints@#%^&*22
but no violations were cited.@#%^&*22
Thrift regulators didn't give any figures on their enforcement actions.@#%^&*23
Mr. Fiechter said@#%^&*24
that among the possibilities@#%^&*24
being considered by regulators@#%^&*24
to fight discrimination@#%^&*24
is the use of "testers"@#%^&*24
-- government investigators@#%^&*24
who would pose as home buyers.@#%^&*24
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has used testers@#%^&*25
to investigate discrimination in rental housing.@#%^&*25
Using testers could be controversial with financial institutions,@#%^&*26
but Mr. Grohl said@#%^&*26
the U.S. League of Savings Institutions hadn't yet taken any position on the matter.@#%^&*26

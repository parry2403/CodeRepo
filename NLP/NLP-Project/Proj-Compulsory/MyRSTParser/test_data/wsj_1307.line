In a startling turnabout, Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining@#%^&*1
that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them.@#%^&*1
David Boren, the Intelligence Committee chairman, is upset@#%^&*2
that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration@#%^&*2
suggesting@#%^&*2
that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup@#%^&*2
that might result in his assassination.@#%^&*2
With due respect to "highly classified correspondence" and other buzzwords, the leakers are performing a public service.@#%^&*3
If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega,@#%^&*4
the American people ought to know.@#%^&*4
What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry.@#%^&*5
Naturally, Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein@#%^&*6
to blame the executive branch@#%^&*6
while stamping "top secret" on their own complicity.@#%^&*6
But there's no danger@#%^&*7
of exposing sources and methods@#%^&*7
in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue.@#%^&*7
And@#%^&*8
if Congress is going to assume authority@#%^&*8
to micromanage foreign policy,@#%^&*8
it's going to have to take some of the responsibility too.@#%^&*8
The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega.@#%^&*9
When they did,@#%^&*10
his commanders didn't have the initiative@#%^&*10
to do more than block a couple of roads.@#%^&*10
The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity.@#%^&*11
But what kind of initiative can you expect@#%^&*12
given the climate set by Congress?@#%^&*12
For example, what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations?@#%^&*12
What part did U.S. warnings play in the major's unwillingness@#%^&*12
to pull the trigger@#%^&*12
when he had General Noriega in custody,@#%^&*12
but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops?@#%^&*12
Mr. Noriega didn't suffer from any hesitation@#%^&*12
once he had the pistol.@#%^&*12
Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning:@#%^&*13
You have the right@#%^&*13
to conceal your coup intentions,@#%^&*13
because we may rat on you.@#%^&*13
Or maybe a Surgeon General's warning:@#%^&*14
Confiding in the United States may be fatal.@#%^&*14
CIA chief William Webster, hardly a Washington malcontent, got the debate started last week@#%^&*15
by noting@#%^&*15
that the executive order@#%^&*15
banning assassinations@#%^&*15
had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup.@#%^&*15
The CIA's Deputy Director of Operations, Richard Stoltz, tried to smooth things over a few days later,@#%^&*16
but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster's point.@#%^&*16
"The interpretation" of the executive order,@#%^&*17
Mr. Stoltz said,@#%^&*17
"and the way@#%^&*17
in which the various committees have over time interpreted it,@#%^&*17
has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators,@#%^&*17
including me."@#%^&*17
In other words, Congress won't let the CIA do much of anything anymore,@#%^&*18
and that's fine with the CIA.@#%^&*18
The pay's the same,@#%^&*19
and the duty's lighter.@#%^&*19
And of course, doing anything@#%^&*20
that might be second-guessed by Congress@#%^&*20
carries heavy penalties.@#%^&*20
Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North.@#%^&*21
The Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Senator William Cohen, joined with Senator George Mitchell@#%^&*22
to write a best seller about Iran-Contra,@#%^&*22
deploring "Men of Zeal."@#%^&*22
No doubt many people in the CIA, the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it.@#%^&*23
What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line@#%^&*24
who've read all this@#%^&*24
and know what can happen@#%^&*24
if they fail?@#%^&*24
Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play?@#%^&*24
The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set, a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action.@#%^&*24
President Bush would do himself and the country a favor@#%^&*25
by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability@#%^&*25
to defend America's national security.@#%^&*25
There are of course good reasons@#%^&*26
the U.S. shouldn't get into the assassination business,@#%^&*26
but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing@#%^&*26
as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars.@#%^&*26
The world being the nasty place@#%^&*27
it is,@#%^&*27
we want Presidents to have the freedom@#%^&*27
to order operations@#%^&*27
in which someone might get killed.@#%^&*27
In such situations, you cannot write rules in advance,@#%^&*28
you can only make sure@#%^&*28
the President takes the responsibility.@#%^&*28
The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral.@#%^&*29
As it now stands,@#%^&*30
the U.S. can bomb Tripoli,@#%^&*30
but can't "assassinate" Colonel Gadhafi.@#%^&*30
It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley,@#%^&*31
but can't shoot Abu Nidal.@#%^&*31
Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world@#%^&*32
that the only way@#%^&*32
the U.S. will kill a madman@#%^&*32
is by making sure@#%^&*32
we take some innocent civilians with him.@#%^&*32

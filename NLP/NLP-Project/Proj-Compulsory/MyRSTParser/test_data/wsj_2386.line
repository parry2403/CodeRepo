Small investors matched their big institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend,@#%^&*1
but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach@#%^&*1
and said@#%^&*1
they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market.@#%^&*1
"I'm not losing faith in the market,"@#%^&*2
said Boston lawyer Christopher Sullivan@#%^&*2
as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm.@#%^&*2
But he's not so sure about everyone else.@#%^&*3
"I think@#%^&*4
on Monday the small (investors) are going to panic and sell,"@#%^&*4
predicted Mr. Sullivan,@#%^&*4
whose investments include AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and several mutual funds.@#%^&*4
"And I think@#%^&*5
institutions are going to come in and buy . . .@#%^&*5
I'm going to hold on.@#%^&*6
If I sell now,@#%^&*7
I'll take a big loss."@#%^&*7
Some evinced an optimism@#%^&*8
that had been rewarded@#%^&*8
when they didn't flee the market in 1987.@#%^&*8
"Oh, I bet@#%^&*9
it'll be up 50 points on Monday,"@#%^&*9
said Lucy Crump, a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington, Ky.@#%^&*9
Mrs. Crump said@#%^&*10
her Ashwood Investment Club's portfolio lost about one-third of its value@#%^&*10
following the Black Monday crash,@#%^&*10
"but no one got discouraged,@#%^&*10
and we gained that back@#%^&*10
-- and more."@#%^&*10
At the annual congress of the National Association of Investors Corp. at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Minneapolis, the scene was calm.@#%^&*11
Some 500 investors@#%^&*12
representing investor clubs from around the U.S.@#%^&*12
were attending@#%^&*13
when the market started to slide Friday.@#%^&*13
But Robert Showalter, an official of the association, said@#%^&*14
no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors' clubs are planned.@#%^&*14
In fact, some of the association's members@#%^&*15
-- long-term, buy-and-hold investors --@#%^&*15
welcomed the drop in prices.@#%^&*15
"We hope to take advantage of it,"@#%^&*16
said John Snyder, a member of a Los Angeles investors' club.@#%^&*16
He has four stocks in mind@#%^&*17
to buy@#%^&*17
if the prices drop to the level@#%^&*17
he wants.@#%^&*17
Not everyone is reacting so calmly, however,@#%^&*18
and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday's slide, reluctance by banks@#%^&*18
to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.@#%^&*18
Marc Perkins, a Tampa, Fla., investment banker, said@#%^&*19
the market drop is one of "a tremendous number of signs@#%^&*19
that the leveraged take-out era is ending.@#%^&*19
There's no question@#%^&*20
that there's a general distaste for leverage among lenders."@#%^&*20
Mr. Perkins believes, however,@#%^&*21
that the market could be stabilized@#%^&*21
if California investor Marvin Davis steps back in to the United bidding with an offer of $275 a share.@#%^&*21
Sara Albert, a 34-year-old Dallas law student, says@#%^&*22
she's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity@#%^&*22
that seems to fuel it.@#%^&*22
"I have this feeling@#%^&*23
that it's built on sand,"@#%^&*23
she says,@#%^&*23
that the market rises@#%^&*23
"but there's no foundation to it."@#%^&*23
She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash,@#%^&*24
although she still owns some Texaco stock.@#%^&*24
Partly because of concern about the economy@#%^&*25
and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant@#%^&*25
to go to school,@#%^&*25
"I think at this point@#%^&*25
we want to be a lot more liquid."@#%^&*25
Others wonder@#%^&*26
how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand.@#%^&*26
"We all assumed@#%^&*27
October '87 was a one-time shot,"@#%^&*27
said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg.@#%^&*27
"We told the little guy@#%^&*28
it could only happen once in a lifetime,@#%^&*28
come on back.@#%^&*28
Now it's happening again."@#%^&*29
Mr. Greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash@#%^&*30
and, to his regret, never went back@#%^&*30
even as the market soared.@#%^&*30
This time he's ready to buy in@#%^&*31
"when the panic wears off."@#%^&*31
Still, he adds:@#%^&*32
"We can't have this kind of thing happen very often.@#%^&*32
When the little guy gets frightened,@#%^&*33
the big guys hurt badly.@#%^&*33
Merrill Lynch can't survive@#%^&*34
without the little guy."@#%^&*34
Small investors have tiptoed back into the market@#%^&*35
following Black Monday,@#%^&*35
but mostly through mutual funds.@#%^&*35
Discount brokerage customers "have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog@#%^&*36
like they were two years ago,"@#%^&*36
says Leslie Quick Jr., chairman of the Quick & Reilly discount brokerage firm.@#%^&*36
Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president at Charles Scwhab Corp., says@#%^&*37
Schwab customers "have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks."@#%^&*37
Individual investors are still angry about program trading,@#%^&*38
Mr. Quackenbush says.@#%^&*38
Avner Arbel, a Cornell University finance professor, says@#%^&*39
government regulators will have to more closely control program trading@#%^&*39
to "win back the confidence of the small investor."@#%^&*39
But it's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried.@#%^&*40
Alan Helfman, general sales manager of a Chrysler dealership in Houston, said@#%^&*41
he and his mother have some joint stock investments,@#%^&*41
but the overall economy is his chief worry.@#%^&*41
"These high rollers took a big bath today,"@#%^&*42
he said in his showroom,@#%^&*42
which is within a few miles of the multi-million dollar homes of some of Houston's richest citizens.@#%^&*42
"And I can tell you@#%^&*43
that a high roller isn't going to come in tomorrow@#%^&*43
and buy a Chrysler TC by Maserati."@#%^&*43
And, finally, there were the gloaters.@#%^&*44
"I got out in 1987.@#%^&*45
Everything,"@#%^&*46
said Pascal Antori, an Akron, Ohio, plumbing contractor@#%^&*46
who was visiting Chicago@#%^&*46
and stopped by Fidelity Investments' LaSalle Street office.@#%^&*46
"I just stopped by@#%^&*47
to see@#%^&*47
how much I would have lost."@#%^&*47
Would Mr. Antori ever get back in?@#%^&*48
"Are you kidding!@#%^&*48
When it comes to money:@#%^&*48
Once bitten, 2,000 times shy."@#%^&*48

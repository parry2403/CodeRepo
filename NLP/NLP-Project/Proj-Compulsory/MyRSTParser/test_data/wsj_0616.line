As competition heats up in Spain's crowded bank market,@#%^&*1
Banco Exterior de Espana is seeking to shed its image of a state-owned bank and move into new activities.@#%^&*1
Under the direction of its new chairman, Francisco Luzon, Spain's seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring@#%^&*2
that@#%^&*2
analysts say@#%^&*2
may be the first step toward the bank's privatization.@#%^&*2
The state-owned industrial holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly hold a 13.94% stake in Banco Exterior.@#%^&*3
The government directly owns 51.4%@#%^&*4
and Factorex, a financial services company, holds 8.42%.@#%^&*4
The rest is listed on Spanish stock exchanges.@#%^&*5
Some analysts are concerned, however,@#%^&*6
that Banco Exterior may have waited too long@#%^&*6
to diversify from its traditional export-related activities.@#%^&*6
Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services,@#%^&*7
they argue,@#%^&*7
will be difficult,@#%^&*7
particularly if market conditions turn sour.@#%^&*7
If that proves true,@#%^&*8
analysts say@#%^&*8
Banco Exterior could be a prime partner@#%^&*8
-- or even a takeover target --@#%^&*8
for either a Spanish or foreign bank@#%^&*8
seeking to increase its market share after 1992,@#%^&*8
when the European Community plans to dismantle financial barriers.@#%^&*8
With 700 branches in Spain and 12 banking subsidiaries, five branches and 12 representative offices abroad, the Banco Exterior group has a lot@#%^&*9
to offer a potential suitor.@#%^&*9
Mr. Luzon and his team, however, say@#%^&*10
they aren't interested in a merger.@#%^&*10
Instead, they are working@#%^&*11
to transform Banco Exterior into an efficient bank by the end of 1992.@#%^&*11
"I want this to be a model of the way@#%^&*12
a public-owned company should be run,"@#%^&*12
Mr. Luzon says.@#%^&*12
Banco Exterior was created in 1929@#%^&*13
to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports.@#%^&*13
The market for export financing was liberalized in the mid-1980s, however,@#%^&*14
forcing the bank to face competition.@#%^&*14
At the same time, many of Spain's traditional export markets in Latin America and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth.@#%^&*15
As a result, the volume of Banco Exterior's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas@#%^&*16
($7.04 billion)@#%^&*16
as of Dec. 31, 1986, to its current 522 billion pesetas.@#%^&*16
The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior's traditional business@#%^&*17
-- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading --@#%^&*17
also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs.@#%^&*17
The bank was hamstrung in its efforts@#%^&*18
to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government,@#%^&*18
analysts say.@#%^&*18
Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November,@#%^&*19
Banco Exterior was run by politicians@#%^&*19
who lacked either the skills or the will@#%^&*19
to introduce innovative changes.@#%^&*19
But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly@#%^&*20
to streamline bureaucracy,@#%^&*20
cut costs,@#%^&*20
increase capital@#%^&*20
and build up new areas of business.@#%^&*20
"We've got a lot@#%^&*21
to do,"@#%^&*21
he acknowledged.@#%^&*21
"We've got to move quickly."@#%^&*22
In Mr. Luzon's first year, the bank eliminated 800 jobs.@#%^&*23
Now it says@#%^&*24
it'll trim another 1,200 jobs over the next three to four years.@#%^&*24
The bank employs 8,000 people in Spain and 2,000 abroad.@#%^&*25
To strengthen its capital base,@#%^&*26
Banco Exterior this year issued $105 million in subordinated debt,@#%^&*26
launched two rights issues@#%^&*26
and sold stock held in its treasury to small investors.@#%^&*26
The bank is now aggressively marketing retail services at its domestic branches.@#%^&*27
Last year's drop in export credit was partially offset by a 15% surge in lending to individuals and small and medium-sized companies.@#%^&*28
Though Spain has an excess of banks,@#%^&*29
analysts say@#%^&*29
the country still has one of the most profitable markets in Europe,@#%^&*29
which will aid Banco Exterior with the tough tasks@#%^&*29
it faces ahead.@#%^&*29
Expansion plans also include acquisitions in growing foreign markets.@#%^&*30
The bank says@#%^&*31
it's interested in purchasing banks in Morocco, Portugal and Puerto Rico.@#%^&*31
But the bank's retail activities in Latin America are likely to be cut back.@#%^&*32
Banco Exterior was one of the last banks@#%^&*33
to create a brokerage house@#%^&*33
before the four Spanish stock exchanges underwent sweeping changes in July.@#%^&*33
The late start may be a handicap for the bank@#%^&*34
as Spain continues to open up its market to foreign competition.@#%^&*34
But Mr. Luzon contends@#%^&*35
that the experienced team@#%^&*35
he brought with him from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya,@#%^&*35
where he was formerly director general,@#%^&*35
will whip the bank's capital market division into shape by the end of 1992.@#%^&*35
The bank also says@#%^&*36
it'll use its international network@#%^&*36
to channel investment from London, Frankfurt, Zurich and Paris into the Spanish stock exchanges.@#%^&*36

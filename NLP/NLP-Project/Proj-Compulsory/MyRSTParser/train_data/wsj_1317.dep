to take "executive responsibility" for an embarrassing effort@#%^&*('take', 'retire', 'U')	('to', 'discredit', 'U')

American Express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. Safra.@#%^&*('influenced', 'ROOT', 'R')

people close to Mr. Roman say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')

because of efforts by Mr. Sorrell, a financial man,@#%^&*('efforts', 'tension', 'U')	('Sorrell', 'cite', 'U')	
to cut costs at the agency.@#%^&*('cut', 'cite', 'U')	
Mr. Roman will be succeeded as the head of Ogilvy's flagship ad agency, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, by Graham Phillips, 50,@#%^&*('succeeded', 'ROOT', 'R')

for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow@#%^&*('squeaky', 'reputation', 'U')	('arrow', 'honed', 'U')	('arrow', 'reputation', 'U')	('arrow', 'help', 'U')	
-- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident.@#%^&*('help', 'arrow', 'U')

Mr. Roman said,@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
he agreed to take the job@#%^&*('agreed', 'said', 'U')	('agreed', 'said', 'U')	
because "it's the right time,@#%^&*('time', 'take', 'U')	('it', 'opportunity', 'U')	("'s", 'opportunity', 'U')	('a', 'opportunity', 'U')

I leave the company in very strong hands.@#%^&*('leave', 'think', 'U')	
It was my decision, not anyone else's."@#%^&*('decision', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Roman also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and Mr. Phillips, his successor at Ogilvy.@#%^&*('brushed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The two executives could hardly be more different.@#%^&*('different', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Roman comes across as a low-key executive;@#%^&*('comes', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Mr.', 'Phillips', 'U')

the move won't affect their relationships with the ad agency.@#%^&*('affect', 'said', 'U')

said David Hurwitt, a vice president of Kraft General Foods.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')

that Mr. Phillips isn't as well-known to many clients.@#%^&*('well', 'expressed', 'U')	
"Ken was my key contact,"@#%^&*('contact', 'said', 'U')

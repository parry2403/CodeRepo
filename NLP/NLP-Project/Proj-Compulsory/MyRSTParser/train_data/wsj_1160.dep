California legislators,@#%^&*('legislators', 'laying', 'U')	
searching for ways@#%^&*('searching', 'laying', 'U')	
to pay for the $4 billion to $6 billion in damages from last week's earthquake,@#%^&*('pay', 'searching', 'U')	
are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state's sales tax.@#%^&*('laying', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question@#%^&*('follows', 'ROOT', 'R')	
of how much the federal government is willing to spend@#%^&*('government', 'aid', 'U')	('willing', 'question', 'U')	('to', 'aid', 'U')	
to aid in California's earthquake relief efforts.@#%^&*('aid', 'spend', 'U')	
The state had sought as much as $4.1 billion in relief,@#%^&*('sought', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure@#%^&*('approved', 'sought', 'U')	('a', 'calling', 'U')	('general', 'calling', 'U')	('scaled', 'calling', 'U')	('measure', 'calling', 'U')	
calling for $2.85 billion in aid,@#%^&*('calling', 'approved', 'U')	('$', 'approved', 'U')	('aid', 'approved', 'U')	('aid', 'bulk', 'U')	
the bulk of which would go to California, with an unspecified amount@#%^&*('go', 'aid', 'U')	('amount', 'approved', 'U')	
going to regions@#%^&*('going', 'amount', 'U')	
affected by Hurricane Hugo.@#%^&*('affected', 'regions', 'U')	
That leaves the state roughly $2 billion to $4 billion short.@#%^&*('leaves', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry.@#%^&*('appears', 'ROOT', 'R')	
According to the state department of finance,@#%^&*('to', 'raise', 'U')	('department', 'raise', 'U')	('a', 'increase', 'U')	
a one-penny increase in the state's six-cent per dollar sales tax could raise $3 billion.@#%^&*('raise', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Willie Brown, speaker of California's Assembly, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks.@#%^&*('agreed', 'said', 'U')	
California's so-called Gann limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money@#%^&*('limit', 'limits', 'U')	('prevents', 'ROOT', 'R')	('so', 'drastically', 'U')	
and so drastically limits its options in an emergency.@#%^&*('limits', 'prevents', 'U')	
Both Mr. Brown, the state's most influential legislator, and Gov. Deukmejian favor a temporary sales tax increase@#%^&*('Brown', 'needed', 'U')	('favor', 'needed', 'U')	
-- should more money be needed@#%^&*('needed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government.@#%^&*('raise', 'needed', 'U')	
According to a spokesman,@#%^&*('to', 'studying', 'U')	('spokesman', 'studying', 'U')	
the governor is also studying the possibility@#%^&*('studying', 'ROOT', 'R')	
of raising state gasoline taxes.@#%^&*('raising', 'possibility', 'U')	
Mr. Brown, meanwhile, believes@#%^&*('believes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"only one tax will be feasible,@#%^&*('feasible', 'said', 'U')	
and it will be a one-penny sales tax increase,"@#%^&*('increase', 'feasible', 'U')	('increase', 'said', 'U')	
said Chuck Dalldorf, an aide.@#%^&*('said', 'believes', 'U')	
One immediate source of money is an emergency fund@#%^&*('fund', 'ROOT', 'R')	
set up by Gov. Deukmejian.@#%^&*('set', 'fund', 'U')	
The fund has about $1 billion@#%^&*('fund', 'set', 'U')	('fund', 'handle', 'U')	('has', 'said', 'U')	
and is set up@#%^&*('set', 'has', 'U')	('set', 'said', 'U')	
to handle "precisely the kind of emergency"@#%^&*('handle', 'set', 'U')	('the', 'state', 'U')	
the state faces,@#%^&*('faces', 'kind', 'U')	
said Tom Beermann, the Governor's deputy press secretary.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the fund's size is disputed by Mr. Brown's office,@#%^&*('disputed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('office', 'estimates', 'U')	
which estimates@#%^&*('estimates', 'office', 'U')	
the fund holds from $630 million to $800 million.@#%^&*('holds', 'estimates', 'U')	
Moreover, an aide to Mr. Brown said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Gov. Deukmejian "has expressed a desire@#%^&*('expressed', 'said', 'U')	
not to spend all the reserve on this."@#%^&*('spend', 'expressed', 'U')	
To push through a sales tax increase, however,@#%^&*('push', 'have', 'U')	('however', 'have', 'U')	
the state will have to suspend the Gann limit,@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	
citing an emergency.@#%^&*('citing', 'suspend', 'U')	
And then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period@#%^&*('required', 'said', 'U')	
after the temporary tax increase ends,@#%^&*('ends', 'lower', 'U')	
said Cindy Katz, assistant director of the state department of finance.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A sales tax increase would require two-thirds approval in both houses of the state's legislature.@#%^&*('require', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But observers expect broad support.@#%^&*('expect', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"If there's an emergency@#%^&*("'s", 'think', 'U')	('there', 'are', 'U')	
and there aren't sufficient funds from elsewhere,@#%^&*('are', "'s", 'U')	('are', 'think', 'U')	
I think@#%^&*('think', 'said', 'U')	
the attitude will be supportive,"@#%^&*('supportive', 'think', 'U')	
said Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But others think@#%^&*('think', 'ROOT', 'R')	
property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state's earthquake relief tab.@#%^&*('ought', 'think', 'U')	
Since the late 1970s, California property owners have benefited from a tax rollback@#%^&*('benefited', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'result', 'U')	
as a result of a state ballot initiative@#%^&*('result', 'benefited', 'U')	
known as Proposition 13.@#%^&*('known', 'initiative', 'U')	
The state could also increase gasoline taxes;@#%^&*('increase', 'ROOT', 'R')	
every one penny increase in the tax would yield $11 million a month.@#%^&*
But Gov. Deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything@#%^&*('reluctant', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'harm', 'U')	
to harm the state's chances@#%^&*('harm', 'do', 'U')	
of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis.@#%^&*('raising', 'chances', 'U')	
To raise more highway funds,@#%^&*('raise', 'set', 'U')	('a', 'measure', 'U')	
a measure@#%^&*('measure', 'set', 'U')	('measure', 'appear', 'U')	
to double the state's nine-cent a gallon tax over five years@#%^&*('double', 'measure', 'U')	
is set to appear on the state's June election ballot.@#%^&*('set', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But some fear@#%^&*('But', 'support', 'U')	('fear', 'support', 'U')	
imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure.@#%^&*('imposing', 'fear', 'U')	('support', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Not everyone is convinced@#%^&*('convinced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the state must raise new revenue@#%^&*('raise', 'convinced', 'U')	
to meet its earthquake needs.@#%^&*('meet', 'raise', 'U')	
"It's possible, though not probable," that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help,@#%^&*('possible', 'said', 'U')	
said Quentin Kopp, chairman of the state senate's transportation committee.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Separately, two men@#%^&*('Separately', 'began', 'U')	('men', 'began', 'U')	
injured in last week's earthquake-triggered freeway collapse in Oakland@#%^&*('injured', 'men', 'U')	
began a legal battle against the state@#%^&*('began', 'ROOT', 'R')	
over whether officials adequately heeded warnings about the structure's safety.@#%^&*('heeded', 'began', 'U')	
The claims,@#%^&*('claims', 'filed', 'U')	('claims', 'end', 'U')	('claims', 'first', 'U')	
which were filed with the State Board of Control@#%^&*('filed', 'claims', 'U')	
but will probably end up in court,@#%^&*('end', 'claims', 'U')	('end', 'filed', 'U')	
are the first@#%^&*('first', 'ROOT', 'R')	
arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct.@#%^&*('arising', 'first', 'U')	
The men can defeat immunities@#%^&*('defeat', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that states often assert in court@#%^&*('assert', 'defeat', 'U')	
by showing@#%^&*('showing', 'assert', 'U')	
that officials knew or should have known@#%^&*('knew', 'showing', 'U')	('known', 'showing', 'U')	('that', 'defective', 'U')	
that design of the structure was defective@#%^&*('defective', 'known', 'U')	('that', 'failed', 'U')	
and that they failed to make reasonable changes.@#%^&*('failed', 'known', 'U')	('failed', 'defective', 'U')	
A Board of Control spokesman@#%^&*('spokesman', 'said', 'U')	
said the board had not seen the claim@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	('board', 'declined', 'U')	('board', 'comment', 'U')	
and declined to comment.@#%^&*('declined', 'said', 'U')	('declined', 'seen', 'U')

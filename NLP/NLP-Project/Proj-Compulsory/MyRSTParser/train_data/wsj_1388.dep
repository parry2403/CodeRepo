When Robert McDuffie was 14,@#%^&*('14', 'got', 'U')	('he', 'got', 'U')	
he got a chance@#%^&*('got', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in Macon, Ga.@#%^&*('play', 'chance', 'U')	
Unfortunately, his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman the same night,@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and she was adamant about his attending.@#%^&*('adamant', 'had', 'U')	
"I threw such a fit,"@#%^&*('threw', 'says', 'U')	
says Mr. McDuffie,@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	('McDuffie', 'begun', 'U')	
who had begun violin studies at the age of six.@#%^&*('begun', 'McDuffie', 'U')	
"But@#%^&*('But', 'give', 'U')	
once Perlman started playing,@#%^&*('started', 'give', 'U')	
I didn't give a damn about basketball. . . .@#%^&*('give', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Afterwards, I went home@#%^&*('I', 'practiced', 'U')	('went', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and practiced for three hours."@#%^&*('practiced', 'went', 'U')	
Today, it's obvious that the brawny, six-foot, one-inch musician made the right choice.@#%^&*('obvious', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At 31, Mr. McDuffie has a rich, full-bodied tone, an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule.@#%^&*('has', 'ROOT', 'R')	
He's currently in the midst of a 17-city U.S. tour with Yehudi Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia, with stops@#%^&*("'s", 'ROOT', 'R')	
including Charleston, S.C.@#%^&*('S.C.', 'stops', 'U')	
(Oct. 25),@#%^&*('25', 'Fla.', 'U')	
Sarasota, Fla.@#%^&*('Sarasota', '25', 'U')	('Fla.', 'ROOT', 'R')	
(Oct. 28),@#%^&*('28', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Tampa, Fla.@#%^&*('Fla.', '28', 'U')	
(Oct. 29)@#%^&*('Oct.', 'Miami', 'U')	
and Miami@#%^&*('Miami', 'ROOT', 'R')	
(Oct. 31).@#%^&*('Oct.', 'Miami', 'U')	
Later this season he gives a recital at Washington's Kennedy Center,@#%^&*('season', 'appears', 'U')	('gives', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and appears as soloist with several major orchestras.@#%^&*('appears', 'gives', 'U')	
Yet Mr. McDuffie's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries.@#%^&*('developed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
During the late 1970s, he was part of a musical "brat pack"@#%^&*('part', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'group', 'U')	
-- a group of budding virtuosos@#%^&*('group', 'pack', 'U')	('group', 'studied', 'U')	
who studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay.@#%^&*('studied', 'group', 'U')	
His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz, a protege of Isaac Stern@#%^&*('included', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Mintz', 'performed', 'U')	
who performed with major orchestras while still a student;@#%^&*('performed', 'Mintz', 'U')	
Cho-Liang Lin,@#%^&*('Lin', 'Mintz', 'U')	('Lin', 'joined', 'U')	
who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18;@#%^&*('joined', 'Lin', 'U')	
and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg,@#%^&*('Salerno', 'Mintz', 'U')	('Salerno', 'launched', 'U')	
who launched her career@#%^&*('launched', 'Salerno', 'U')	
by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition.@#%^&*('winning', 'launched', 'U')	
"I thought@#%^&*('thought', 'recalls', 'U')	('I', 'was', 'U')	
I was over the hill at 22,"@#%^&*('was', 'thought', 'U')	
recalls Mr. McDuffie, an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl.@#%^&*('recalls', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"But I wasn't ready for a career at that time."@#%^&*('ready', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Young McDuffie's first violin teacher was Henrik Schwarzenberger, a Hungarian refugee@#%^&*('Schwarzenberger', 'ROOT', 'R')	('refugee', 'taught', 'U')	
who taught in the Macon public school system.@#%^&*('taught', 'refugee', 'U')	
"He taught me how to play like a gypsy,"@#%^&*('taught', 'jokes', 'U')	
jokes the musician.@#%^&*('jokes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"I didn't learn to count@#%^&*('learn', 'ROOT', 'R')	
until I got to Juilliard."@#%^&*('got', 'count', 'U')	
After studies at that conservatory's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor Ivan Galamian, he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay, Mr. Galamian's longtime assistant and, ultimately, his rival.@#%^&*('switched', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"I think@#%^&*('think', 'says', 'U')	('I', 'had', 'U')	('I', 'prove', 'U')	
I had to prove myself to her,"@#%^&*('had', 'think', 'U')	
says Mr. McDuffie.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"But she was always encouraging.@#%^&*('encouraging', 'ROOT', 'R')	
She only put her foot down twice,"@#%^&*('put', 'continues', 'U')	('he', 'continues', 'U')	
he continues.@#%^&*('continues', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"In my freshman year, my roommate was known as a party animal.@#%^&*('known', 'ROOT', 'R')	
She thought@#%^&*('thought', 'ROOT', 'R')	
I wasn't getting my practicing done."@#%^&*('getting', 'thought', 'U')	
As the violinist tells it,@#%^&*('tells', 'took', 'U')	('it', 'put', 'U')	('it', 'stomped', 'U')	('it', 'said', 'U')	
his grandmotherly looking teacher "put her hands on her hips,@#%^&*('put', 'tells', 'U')	
stomped her foot@#%^&*('stomped', 'tells', 'U')	('stomped', 'put', 'U')	
and said,@#%^&*('said', 'tells', 'U')	('said', 'put', 'U')	
`You've just got to get the {expletive deleted} out of there. '"@#%^&*('got', 'said', 'U')	
The second incident took place@#%^&*('took', 'ROOT', 'R')	
after Mr. McDuffie gave an ambitious student recital@#%^&*('McDuffie', 'feeling', 'U')	('gave', 'took', 'U')	
and was feeling rather pleased with himself.@#%^&*('feeling', 'took', 'U')	('feeling', 'gave', 'U')	
Miss DeLay requested@#%^&*('requested', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital.@#%^&*('come', 'requested', 'U')	
"We listened to the Chausson `Poeme, '"@#%^&*('listened', 'ROOT', 'R')	('he', 'recalls', 'U')	
he recalls,@#%^&*('recalls', 'listened', 'U')	
"and she said,@#%^&*('said', 'listened', 'U')	
`You hear the first note, that B-flat?@#%^&*('hear', 'said', 'U')	
That's the only note@#%^&*('note', 'hear', 'U')	
that's truly in tune . . .'."@#%^&*("'s", 'note', 'U')	
"That's the most important experience@#%^&*('experience', 'ROOT', 'R')	
I've had with any teacher,"@#%^&*('had', 'experience', 'U')	('he', 'says', 'U')	
he says,@#%^&*('says', 'experience', 'U')	
"because she taught me how to listen.@#%^&*('taught', 'experience', 'U')	
Now,@#%^&*('Now', 'compliment', 'U')	
when I play with orchestras,@#%^&*('play', 'compliment', 'U')	
the musicians often compliment me on my intonation."@#%^&*('compliment', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative, 20th-century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber.@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	
After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter's "Violin Concerto,"@#%^&*('winning', 'invited', 'U')	
Mr. McDuffie was invited to play the work for the composer,@#%^&*('invited', 'ROOT', 'R')	('composer', 'dying', 'U')	('was', 'dying', 'U')	
who was dying of cancer.@#%^&*('dying', 'composer', 'U')	
"Barber was seated by the fireplace@#%^&*('seated', 'recalls', 'U')	
looking very pale,"@#%^&*('looking', 'fireplace', 'U')	
recalls the violinist,@#%^&*('recalls', 'ROOT', 'R')	('violinist', 'performed', 'U')	
who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer's apartment.@#%^&*('performed', 'violinist', 'U')	
"He didn't say much,@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but what he said was important@#%^&*('important', 'say', 'U')	
because it's not in the score.@#%^&*("'s", 'important', 'U')	
There's a beautiful, Coplandesque motif@#%^&*("'s", 'ROOT', 'R')	('he', 'kill', 'U')	
-- he'd kill me@#%^&*('kill', "'s", 'U')	
if he heard me say that --@#%^&*('heard', 'kill', 'U')	
throughout the first movement . . .@#%^&*('movement', "'s", 'U')	
The only time@#%^&*('time', 'right', 'U')	
the violin has it@#%^&*('has', 'time', 'U')	
is right at the end.@#%^&*('right', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It's written `marcato' in the score,@#%^&*('written', 'ROOT', 'R')	('I', 'played', 'U')	
and I played it that way, kind of gigue-like.@#%^&*('played', 'written', 'U')	
And he yelled out@#%^&*('yelled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
`dolce! dolce!' {`sweet! sweet!'}."@#%^&*('dolce', 'yelled', 'U')	('sweet', 'yelled', 'U')	
"So we did it over,"@#%^&*('did', 'adds', 'U')	
he adds.@#%^&*('adds', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"I played very transparently, with the tip of the bow.@#%^&*('played', 'ROOT', 'R')	
If a conductor is sensitive enough@#%^&*('conductor', 'bring', 'U')	('sensitive', 'makes', 'U')	('to', 'bring', 'U')	
to bring down the orchestra {volume} at that point,@#%^&*('bring', 'sensitive', 'U')	
it makes the piece magical.@#%^&*('makes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
I don't know@#%^&*('know', 'ROOT', 'R')	
why Barber never told anybody else.@#%^&*('told', 'know', 'U')	
On Isaac Stern's recording it's very biting."@#%^&*('biting', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Since leaving Juilliard,@#%^&*('leaving', 'made', 'U')	
Mr. McDuffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones.@#%^&*('made', 'ROOT', 'R')	
His guest appearance on the NBC soap opera "Another World," scandalized musical elitists.@#%^&*('scandalized', 'ROOT', 'R')	
By contrast, he's won kudos for his espousal of William Schuman's "Violin Concerto,"@#%^&*('won', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Concerto', 'recorded', 'U')	('he', 'recorded', 'U')	
which he recently recorded for Angel/EMI along with Leonard Bernstein's engaging "Serenade for Violin Solo, Strings and Percussion."@#%^&*('recorded', 'Concerto', 'U')	
Mr. McDuffie's sweet tone, heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works.@#%^&*('make', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin's direction,@#%^&*('Aided', 'swings', 'U')	
this "Serenade" really swings.@#%^&*('swings', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Schuman's "Violin Concerto,"@#%^&*('Concerto', 'sounds', 'U')	('Concerto', 'meanders', 'U')	
which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment,@#%^&*('sounds', 'Concerto', 'U')	
meanders until the propulsive "Agitato, fervente."@#%^&*('meanders', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist, brass and timpani.@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At Avery Fisher Hall here, Mr. McDuffie was heard recently with Mr. Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia in more conventional fare@#%^&*('heard', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- Bruch's overwrought "Violin Concerto in G Minor."@#%^&*('Concerto', 'Sinfonia', 'U')	
His performance was so effusive and driven@#%^&*('effusive', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the phrases rarely breathed.@#%^&*('breathed', 'effusive', 'U')	
The 35-member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big, lush sound@#%^&*('played', 'ROOT', 'R')	('sound', 'belied', 'U')	
that belied its size.@#%^&*('belied', 'sound', 'U')	
Whatever he plays,@#%^&*('plays', 'finds', 'U')	
Mr. McDuffie finds satisfaction in the music itself@#%^&*('finds', 'shares', 'U')	
-- "something greater out there than me,"@#%^&*('greater', 'finds', 'U')	
as he puts it during an interview at the Manhattan apartment@#%^&*('he', 'shares', 'U')	
he shares with wife, Camille, a literary publicist.@#%^&*('shares', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"A normal person did not write the Beethoven `Violin Concerto, '"@#%^&*('write', 'declares', 'U')	('he', 'declares', 'U')	
he declares.@#%^&*('declares', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Even when I hear it played badly,@#%^&*('hear', 'humbled', 'U')	('I', 'humbled', 'U')	
I'm still humbled by the piece.@#%^&*('humbled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
If I could ever feel@#%^&*('feel', 'worth', 'U')	('I', 'contributed', 'U')	
I've contributed to it in some way,@#%^&*('contributed', 'feel', 'U')	
then all the hard work has been worth it."@#%^&*('worth', 'ROOT', 'R')

A surprising surge in the U.S. trade deficit raised fears@#%^&*('surge', 'caused', 'U')	('raised', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the nation's export drive has stalled,@#%^&*('stalled', 'raised', 'U')	
and caused new turmoil in financial markets.@#%^&*('caused', 'raised', 'U')	
The merchandise trade deficit widened in August to $10.77 billion,@#%^&*('widened', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the Commerce Department reported,@#%^&*('reported', 'widened', 'U')	('a', 'deterioration', 'U')	
a sharp deterioration from July's $8.24 billion and the largest deficit of any month this year.@#%^&*('deterioration', 'widened', 'U')	('deficit', 'widened', 'U')	
Exports fell for the second month in a row,@#%^&*('fell', 'ROOT', 'R')	
while imports rose to a record.@#%^&*('rose', 'fell', 'U')	
"This is one of the worst trade releases@#%^&*('one', 'said', 'U')	
we've had@#%^&*('had', 'releases', 'U')	
since the dollar troughed out in 1987,"@#%^&*('troughed', 'had', 'U')	
said Geoffrey Dennis, chief international economist at James Capel Inc.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Like most analysts, Mr. Dennis was hesitant to read too much into one month's numbers;@#%^&*('hesitant', 'ROOT', 'R')	('he', 'said', 'U')	
but he said,@#%^&*('said', 'hesitant', 'U')	
"It indicates perhaps@#%^&*('indicates', 'said', 'U')	
that the balance in the U.S. economy is not as good@#%^&*('good', 'indicates', 'U')	('as', 'led', 'U')	
as we've been led to believe."@#%^&*('led', 'good', 'U')	
The number had a troubling effect on Wall Street,@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
suggesting@#%^&*('suggesting', 'had', 'U')	
that more fundamental economic problems may underlie last Friday's stock market slide.@#%^&*('underlie', 'suggesting', 'U')	
The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 60 points after the report's release,@#%^&*('tumbled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
before recovering@#%^&*('recovering', 'tumbled', 'U')	
to close 18.65 points lower at 2638.73.@#%^&*('close', 'recovering', 'U')	
"This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline,"@#%^&*('raises', 'said', 'U')	
said Norman Robertson, chief economist for Mellon Bank.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"It raises questions about more deep-seated problems, the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability@#%^&*('raises', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to come to grips with them."@#%^&*('come', 'raises', 'U')	
The trade report drew yet another unsettling parallel to October 1987.@#%^&*('drew', 'ROOT', 'R')	
On Oct. 14 of that year, the announcement of an unusually large August trade deficit helped trigger a steep market decline.@#%^&*('helped', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The slide continued until the record 508-point market drop on Oct. 19.@#%^&*('continued', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In 1987, however, the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade,@#%^&*('latest', 'ROOT', 'R')	
while the current report comes after a period of improvement.@#%^&*('comes', 'latest', 'U')	
The bleak trade report was played down by the Bush administration.@#%^&*('played', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called the worsening trade figures "disappointing after two very good months."@#%^&*('called', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the deficit was "an unwelcome increase,"@#%^&*('increase', 'said', 'U')	
adding@#%^&*('adding', 'said', 'U')	
that "we're hopeful@#%^&*('we', 'turn', 'U')	('hopeful', 'adding', 'U')	('that', 'situation', 'U')	
that it simply is a one-month situation@#%^&*('situation', 'hopeful', 'U')	
and will turn around."@#%^&*('turn', 'adding', 'U')	('turn', 'hopeful', 'U')	
But the figures reinforced the view of many private analysts@#%^&*('reinforced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has run out of steam.@#%^&*('run', 'reinforced', 'U')	
"The figures today add further evidence@#%^&*('add', 'said', 'U')	('to', 'support', 'U')	
to support the view@#%^&*('support', 'add', 'U')	
that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $110 billion annual rate,"@#%^&*('stalled', 'support', 'U')	
said Jeffrey Scott, a research fellow at the Institute for International Economics here.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"That's still an improvement over last year,@#%^&*('improvement', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but it leads one to conclude@#%^&*('leads', 'improvement', 'U')	
that basically we've gotten all the mileage@#%^&*('gotten', 'conclude', 'U')	('we', 'can', 'U')	
we can@#%^&*('can', 'mileage', 'U')	
out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit."@#%^&*('depreciation', 'can', 'U')	('cuts', 'can', 'U')	
Exports declined for the second consecutive month in August,@#%^&*('declined', 'reported', 'U')	
slipping 0.2% to $30.41 billion,@#%^&*('slipping', 'declined', 'U')	
the Commerce Department reported.@#%^&*('reported', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Imports, on the other hand, leaped 6.4% to a record $41.18 billion.@#%^&*('leaped', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Not only was August's deficit far worse than July's,@#%^&*('worse', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but the government revised the July figure substantially from the $7.58 billion deficit@#%^&*('revised', 'worse', 'U')	('it', 'reported', 'U')	
it had initially reported last month.@#%^&*('reported', 'deficit', 'U')	
Many economists contend@#%^&*('contend', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed@#%^&*('needed', 'contend', 'U')	
before further trade improvement can occur.@#%^&*('occur', 'needed', 'U')	
That's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital,@#%^&*("'s", 'ROOT', 'R')	
overwhelming the nation's capacity to export.@#%^&*('overwhelming', 'feeds', 'U')	
"People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits,@#%^&*('sick', 'said', 'U')	('tired', 'said', 'U')	('the', 'imbalances', 'U')	
but the imbalances are still there@#%^&*('are', 'sick', 'U')	('are', 'said', 'U')	
and they are still a problem,"@#%^&*('problem', 'sick', 'U')	
said Mr. Robertson.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In addition, the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets@#%^&*('rise', 'hurt', 'U')	('increased', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and hurt the country's competitiveness.@#%^&*('hurt', 'increased', 'U')	
Since March, exports have been virtually flat.@#%^&*('flat', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At the same time, William T. Archey, international vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, notes:@#%^&*('notes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more attractive"@#%^&*('made', 'notes', 'U')	
by causing their prices to decline.@#%^&*('causing', 'made', 'U')	
Most economists expect the slowing U.S. economy to curb demand for imports.@#%^&*('expect', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But they foresee little substantial progress in exports unless the dollar and the federal budget deficit come down.@#%^&*('foresee', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"The best result@#%^&*('result', 'see', 'U')	
we could get from these numbers@#%^&*('get', 'result', 'U')	
would be to see the administration and Congress get serious about putting the U.S. on an internationally competitive economic footing,"@#%^&*('be', 'said', 'U')	('serious', 'said', 'U')	
said Howard Lewis, vice president of international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"That must start with cutting the federal budget deficit."@#%^&*('start', 'ROOT', 'R')	
August's decline in exports reflected decreases in sales of industrial supplies, capital goods and food abroad and increases in sales of motor vehicles, parts and engines.@#%^&*('reflected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The jump in imports stemmed from across-the-board increases in purchases of foreign goods.@#%^&*('stemmed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The numbers were adjusted for usual seasonal fluctuations.@#%^&*('adjusted', 'ROOT', 'R')

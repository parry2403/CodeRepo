From the Sept. 30-Oct. 4 issue of The Economist:@#%^&*1
What defeated General Aoun was not only the weight of the Syrian army.@#%^&*1
The weight of Lebanon's history was also against him;@#%^&*2
and it is a history@#%^&*2
Israel is in danger@#%^&*2
of repeating.@#%^&*2
Like Lebanon, and however unfairly, Israel is regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration.@#%^&*3
Its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the Palestinians.@#%^&*4
Like Lebanon, Israel is being remade by demography.@#%^&*5
In Greater Israel more than half the children under six are Muslims.@#%^&*6
Within 25 years Jews will probably be the minority.@#%^&*7
Yet Israel will neither share power with all these Arabs@#%^&*8
nor,@#%^&*8
says its present prime minister,@#%^&*8
redraw its borders closer to its pre-1967 Jewish heartland.@#%^&*8
By not choosing one of these options,@#%^&*9
Israelis will condemn themselves,@#%^&*9
as the Maronites did,@#%^&*9
to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst, and so to the internal erosion of their state.@#%^&*9
Unlike the Maronites, Israel's Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies;@#%^&*10
Jerusalem will become Belfast@#%^&*10
before it becomes Beirut.@#%^&*10
But that is not much of a consolation@#%^&*11
to draw from the failure of General Aoun.@#%^&*11

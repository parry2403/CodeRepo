Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele-Communications Inc. 's plan@#%^&*('considering', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'buy', 'U')	
to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc.,@#%^&*('buy', 'plan', 'U')	('a', 'move', 'U')	
a move@#%^&*('move', 'Inc.', 'U')	('move', 'lead', 'U')	
that could lead to all-out war between the cable industry's two most powerful players.@#%^&*('lead', 'move', 'U')	
Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts,@#%^&*('fighting', 'say', 'U')	
by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining Tele-Communications as investors in Showtime,@#%^&*('attempting', 'fighting', 'U')	('cable', 'executives', 'U')	
cable-TV industry executives say.@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Time officials declined to comment.@#%^&*('declined', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Last week, Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $225 million for a 50% stake in its Showtime subsidiary,@#%^&*('agreed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('stake', 'second', 'U')	
which is a distant second to Time's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV networks to cable subscribers.@#%^&*('second', 'stake', 'U')	
Tele-Communications, the U.S.'s largest cable company, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment.@#%^&*('seek', 'said', 'U')	
Tele-Communications is HBO's largest customer,@#%^&*('customer', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and the two have a number of other business relationships.@#%^&*('have', 'customer', 'U')	
Earlier this year, Time even discussed bringing Tele-Communications in as an investor in HBO,@#%^&*('discussed', 'said', 'U')	
executives at both companies said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The purchase of the Showtime stake is "a direct slap in our face,"@#%^&*('slap', 'said', 'U')	
said one senior Time executive.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Time is expected to mount a legal challenge in U.S. District Court in New York,@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
where Viacom in May filed a $2.5 billion antitrust suit@#%^&*('filed', 'York', 'U')	
charging Time and HBO with monopolizing the pay-TV business and trying to crush competition from Showtime.@#%^&*('charging', 'suit', 'U')	
Executives@#%^&*('Executives', 'say', 'U')	
involved in plotting Time's defense@#%^&*('involved', 'Executives', 'U')	
say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it is now preparing a countersuit@#%^&*('preparing', 'say', 'U')	
naming both Viacom and Tele-Communications as defendants.@#%^&*('naming', 'preparing', 'U')	
The executives say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Time may seek to break up the transaction@#%^&*('seek', 'say', 'U')	
after it is consummated,@#%^&*('it', 'seek', 'U')	('consummated', 'seek', 'U')	
or may seek constraints@#%^&*('seek', 'consummated', 'U')	('constraints', 'prevent', 'U')	
that would prevent Tele-Communications from dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of Showtime.@#%^&*('prevent', 'constraints', 'U')	
Viacom officials declined to comment.@#%^&*('declined', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Jerome Kern, Tele-Communications' chief outside counsel, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
he wasn't aware of Time's legal plans.@#%^&*('aware', 'said', 'U')	
But he said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that any effort by Time@#%^&*('that', 'pot', 'U')	('effort', 'pot', 'U')	
to characterize the Tele-Communications investment in Showtime as anti-competitive@#%^&*('characterize', 'effort', 'U')	
would be "the pot@#%^&*('pot', 'said', 'U')	
calling the kettle black."@#%^&*('calling', 'pot', 'U')	
"It's hard to see how an investment by the largest {cable operator} in the weaker of the two networks is anti-competitive,@#%^&*('hard', 'said', 'U')	
when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest" cable operator,@#%^&*('owned', 'hard', 'U')	
Mr. Kern said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In addition to owning HBO, with 22 million subscribers,@#%^&*('owning', 'operates', 'U')	
Time Warner separately operates cable-TV system@#%^&*('operates', 'ROOT', 'R')	
serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers.@#%^&*('serving', 'system', 'U')	
Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers,@#%^&*('controls', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and Viacom has about one million.@#%^&*('has', 'controls', 'U')	
In its suit against Time, Viacom says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market power.@#%^&*('ownership', 'says', 'U')	('gives', 'says', 'U')	
Time argues@#%^&*('argues', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that@#%^&*('that', 'has', 'U')	
in joining up with Tele-Communications,@#%^&*('joining', 'has', 'U')	
Viacom has potentially more power,@#%^&*('has', 'argues', 'U')	
particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks MTV, VH-1 and Nick at Nite.@#%^&*('owns', 'has', 'U')	
Ironically, Tele-Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business.@#%^&*('worked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Together, they control nearly 40% of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.;@#%^&*('control', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Tele-Communications has a 21.8% stake,@#%^&*('has', 'control', 'U')	
while Time Warner has a 17.8% stake.@#%^&*
But since Time's merger with Warner Communications Inc., relations between the two have become strained.@#%^&*('become', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Each company worries@#%^&*('worries', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the other is becoming too powerful@#%^&*('becoming', 'worries', 'U')	('too', 'integrated', 'U')	
and too vertically integrated.@#%^&*('integrated', 'becoming', 'U')	('integrated', 'powerful', 'U')	
Meanwhile, some legal observers say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the Tele-Communications investment and other developments are weakening Viacom's antitrust suit against Time.@#%^&*('weakening', 'say', 'U')	
Viacom accuses Time in its suit of refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service, The Movie Channel, on Time's Manhattan Cable TV system, one of the nation's largest urban systems.@#%^&*('accuses', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But yesterday, Manhattan Cable announced@#%^&*('announced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it will launch Showtime on Nov. 1 to over 230,000 subscribers.@#%^&*('launch', 'announced', 'U')	
Showtime has also accused HBO of locking up the lion's share of Hollywood's movies@#%^&*('accused', 'ROOT', 'R')	
by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios.@#%^&*('signing', 'locking', 'U')	
But Showtime has continued to sign new contracts with Hollywood studios,@#%^&*('Showtime', 'announced', 'U')	('continued', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and yesterday announced@#%^&*('announced', 'continued', 'U')	
it will buy movies from Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.,@#%^&*('buy', 'announced', 'U')	('Inc.', 'has', 'U')	
which currently has a non-exclusive arrangement with HBO.@#%^&*('has', 'Inc.', 'U')

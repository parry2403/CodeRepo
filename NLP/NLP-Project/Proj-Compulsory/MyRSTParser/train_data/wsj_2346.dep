The real estate slump@#%^&*('slump', 'pushing', 'U')	('slump', 'affecting', 'U')	
that's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing@#%^&*('pushing', 'slump', 'U')

In Manhattan, once-desirable store sites sit vacant@#%^&*('sit', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and newly constructed space has been slow to fill.@#%^&*('slow', 'sit', 'U')	
Retail real estate brokers say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
tenants are reluctant to sign leases@#%^&*('reluctant', 'say', 'U')	
because of uncertainty about the local economy, turmoil in their own industries and a belief@#%^&*('uncertainty', 'leases', 'U')	('economy', 'sign', 'U')	('turmoil', 'sign', 'U')	('belief', 'sign', 'U')	
that rents have not yet hit bottom.@#%^&*('hit', 'sign', 'U')	
"There is an unbelievable amount of space available,"@#%^&*('is', 'says', 'U')	
says Faith Consolo, senior vice president at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
There are about 2,000 stores for rent, up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500.@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"This further confuses retailers,"@#%^&*('confuses', 'says', 'U')	
she says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"They wonder@#%^&*('wonder', 'ROOT', 'R')	
should they sign a lease@#%^&*('sign', 'wonder', 'U')	
if prices are still coming down?@#%^&*('coming', 'sign', 'U')

In addition,@#%^&*('addition', 'says', 'U')	
Ms. Consolo says,@#%^&*('says', 'wonder', 'U')	
tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents@#%^&*('negotiate', 'wonder', 'U')	('rents', 'lower', 'U')	
that are about one-quarter lower than landlords' initial asking price.@#%^&*('lower', 'rents', 'U')	
A handful of hot retail locations, such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas, have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents.@#%^&*('able', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And, in some neighborhoods, rents have merely hit a plateau.@#%^&*('hit', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But on average, Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10% to 15% in the past six months alone,@#%^&*('But', 'say', 'U')	('average', 'say', 'U')	('dropped', 'say', 'U')	
experts say.@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months,@#%^&*('follows', 'ROOT', 'R')	
after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986.@#%^&*('run', 'follows', 'U')

have further deflated the market.@#%^&*('deflated', 'says', 'U')	
Hardest hit are what he calls "secondary" sites@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	('sites', 'serve', 'U')	
that primarily serve neighborhood residents.@#%^&*('serve', 'sites', 'U')	
In these locations,@#%^&*('locations', 'cautious', 'U')	
Mr. Friedman says,@#%^&*('says', 'cautious', 'U')	
"Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding@#%^&*('cautious', 'ROOT', 'R')

It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers@#%^&*('comfort', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when the future of larger department stores,@#%^&*('when', 'are', 'U')	('future', 'anchor', 'U')	('future', 'are', 'U')

The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising@#%^&*('seem', 'ROOT', 'R')	
given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents.@#%^&*('given', 'seem', 'U')	
But,@#%^&*('But', 'big', 'U')	
despite the recent softening,@#%^&*('softening', 'big', 'U')	
for many of these retailers there's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s,@#%^&*('big', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when their leases were signed.@#%^&*('signed', 'big', 'U')	
Certainly, the recent drop in prices doesn't mean Manhattan comes cheap.@#%^&*('mean', 'ROOT', 'R')

By contrast, rentals in the best retail locations in Boston, San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $100 a square foot.@#%^&*('top', 'ROOT', 'R')

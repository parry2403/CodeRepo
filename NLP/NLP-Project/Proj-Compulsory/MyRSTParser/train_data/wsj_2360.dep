which issued the directive,@#%^&*('issued', 'Supervision', 'U')	
saying@#%^&*('saying', 'issued', 'U')	
it was "inappropriate"@#%^&*('it', 'based', 'U')	('inappropriate', 'saying', 'U')	
and based on "insufficient" reasons.@#%^&*('based', 'saying', 'U')	('based', 'inappropriate', 'U')	
He said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision.@#%^&*('try', 'said', 'U')	
The suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step@#%^&*('step', 'ROOT', 'R')	('step', 'signals', 'U')	
that signals@#%^&*('signals', 'step', 'U')	('that', 'have', 'U')	
that regulators have deep concerns about an institution's health.@#%^&*('have', 'signals', 'U')	
In March, regulators labeled CenTrust a "troubled institution,"@#%^&*('labeled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses.@#%^&*('largely', 'institution', 'U')	('holdings', 'institution', 'U')	('losses', 'labeled', 'U')	('losses', 'institution', 'U')	
In the same month, the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends@#%^&*('ordered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
until its operations were on track.@#%^&*('were', 'stop', 'U')	
For the nine months@#%^&*('months', 'had', 'U')	
ended June 30,@#%^&*('ended', 'months', 'U')	
CenTrust had a net loss of $21.3 million,@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
compared with year-earlier net income of $52.8 million.@#%^&*('with', 'had', 'U')	('income', 'had', 'U')	
CenTrust,@#%^&*('CenTrust', 'thrift', 'U')	('CenTrust', 'holds', 'U')	
which is Florida's largest thrift,@#%^&*('thrift', 'CenTrust', 'U')	
holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation.@#%^&*('holds', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Since April, it has pared its high-yield bond holdings to about $890 million from $1.35 billion.@#%^&*('pared', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Paul said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
only about $150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities@#%^&*('securities', 'said', 'U')	
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.@#%^&*('registered', 'securities', 'U')	
The remainder,@#%^&*('remainder', 'participations', 'U')	('he', 'said', 'U')	
he said,@#%^&*('said', 'participations', 'U')	
are commercial loan participations, or private placements,@#%^&*('participations', 'ROOT', 'R')	('participations', 'filed', 'U')	('participations', 'have', 'U')	('placements', 'filed', 'U')	('are', 'filed', 'U')

and don't have a ready market.@#%^&*('have', 'participations', 'U')	('have', 'filed', 'U')	
CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds.@#%^&*('been', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings,@#%^&*('hounding', 'ROOT', 'R')	('CenTrust', 'said', 'U')	('has', 'said', 'U')	
but CenTrust has said@#%^&*('said', 'hounding', 'U')	
it can't easily obtain such values@#%^&*('obtain', 'said', 'U')	
because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market.@#%^&*('illiquidity', 'values', 'U')	
Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust's and other thrifts' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market.@#%^&*('become', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new, somber regulatory climate.@#%^&*('requires', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, CenTrust common shares closed at $3, down 12.5 cents.@#%^&*('closed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In a statement Friday, Mr. Paul challenged the regulators' decision,@#%^&*('challenged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
saying@#%^&*('saying', 'challenged', 'U')	
the thrift's operating losses and "apparent" junk-bond losses "have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank."@#%^&*('offset', 'saying', 'U')	
He also said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds.@#%^&*('set', 'said', 'U')	
In the third quarter, for instance, CenTrust added $22.5 million to its general reserves.@#%^&*('added', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Paul said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the regulators should instead move ahead with approving CenTrust's request@#%^&*('move', 'said', 'U')	('to', 'sell', 'U')	
to sell 63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank, a unit of Great Western Financial Corp.@#%^&*('sell', 'request', 'U')	
based in Beverly Hills, Calif.@#%^&*('based', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The branch sale is the centerpiece of CenTrust's strategy@#%^&*('centerpiece', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to transform itself into a traditional S&L from a high-flying institution@#%^&*('transform', 'strategy', 'U')	('institution', 'relied', 'U')	
that relied heavily on securities trading for profits,@#%^&*('relied', 'institution', 'U')	
according to Mr. Paul.@#%^&*('to', 'relied', 'U')	('Paul', 'relied', 'U')	
Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction,@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	('transaction', 'announced', 'U')	
which was announced in July,@#%^&*('announced', 'transaction', 'U')	
long before now.@#%^&*('long', 'announced', 'U')	
Many interpret the delay as an indication@#%^&*('interpret', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that regulators are skeptical about the proposal.@#%^&*('skeptical', 'interpret', 'U')	
Branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event@#%^&*('sold', 'take', 'U')	
federal regulators take over an institution.@#%^&*('take', 'ROOT', 'R')	
CenTrust, however, touts the branch sale,@#%^&*('touts', 'ROOT', 'R')	
saying@#%^&*('saying', 'touts', 'U')	
it would bring in $150 million@#%^&*('it', 'reduce', 'U')	('bring', 'saying', 'U')	
and reduce the thrift's assets to $6.7 billion from $9 billion.@#%^&*('reduce', 'saying', 'U')	('reduce', 'bring', 'U')	
It said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $82 million, or about 1.2% of assets, from a negative $33 million as of Sept. 30,@#%^&*('give', 'said', 'U')	
thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards.@#%^&*('bringing', 'said', 'U')	('bringing', 'said', 'U')	
CenTrust said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the branch sale would also reduce the company's large amount of good will by about $180 million.@#%^&*('reduce', 'said', 'U')	
Critics, however, say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the branch sale will make CenTrust more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds.@#%^&*('make', 'say', 'U')	
Mr. Paul counters@#%^&*('counters', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that he intends to further pare the size of CenTrust@#%^&*('intends', 'counters', 'U')	
by not renewing more than $1 billion of brokered certificates of deposit@#%^&*('renewing', 'pare', 'U')	
when they come due.@#%^&*('come', 'renewing', 'U')	
The thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio@#%^&*('working', 'ROOT', 'R')	
by continuing to sell off the bonds,@#%^&*('continuing', 'unload', 'U')	
and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate,@#%^&*('plans', 'working', 'U')	
as required under the new thrift law.@#%^&*('required', 'place', 'U')

as Federal bought several local companies,@#%^&*('bought', 'suffered', 'U')

These and other problems squeezed Federal's profit margins last year to 8%, down from more than 13% annually in the first half of the decade.@#%^&*('squeezed', 'ROOT', 'R')

There's a certain irony in the fact@#%^&*("'s", 'ROOT', 'R')

In the early 1970s, Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations.@#%^&*('modeled', 'ROOT', 'R')

Analysts expect Federal's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter@#%^&*('expect', 'ROOT', 'R')	
ending Feb. 28,@#%^&*('ending', 'quarter', 'U')	
when the company should begin benefiting from Tiger's extra flights, back-up planes and landing rights.@#%^&*('begin', 'expect', 'U')	
Until then, they expect the cost@#%^&*('expect', 'ROOT', 'R')	
of integrating the two carriers@#%^&*('integrating', 'cost', 'U')	('carriers', 'continue', 'U')

Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers,@#%^&*('encouraging', 'countenance', 'U')	
Mr. Smith doesn't countenance what he considers insubordination.@#%^&*('countenance', 'ROOT', 'R')	
When a large group of pilots once signed petitions@#%^&*('signed', 'called', 'U')	
opposing work-rule and compensation changes,@#%^&*('opposing', 'signed', 'U')	
he called a meeting in a company hangar@#%^&*('he', 'dressed', 'U')	('called', 'ROOT', 'R')

for challenging his authority.@#%^&*('challenging', 'dressed', 'U')	
He then made most of the changes,@#%^&*('made', 'say', 'U')	
pilots say.@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That sort of approach, however, hasn't worked since the addition of Tiger.@#%^&*('worked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Its 6,500 workers,@#%^&*('workers', 'battled', 'U')	('workers', 'members', 'U')	
who had battled Tiger's management for years over givebacks,@#%^&*('battled', 'workers', 'U')	
were union members until the day of the merger,@#%^&*('members', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when most of their unions were automatically decertified.@#%^&*('decertified', 'members', 'U')	
Soon after the merger, moreover, Federal's management asked Tiger's pilots to sign an agreement@#%^&*('asked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
stating@#%^&*('stating', 'agreement', 'U')	
that they could be fired any time,@#%^&*('fired', 'stating', 'U')

In his haste@#%^&*('haste', 'ignored', 'U')

Mr. Smith ignored a promise@#%^&*('ignored', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that he had made to his own pilots three years ago:@#%^&*('made', 'ignored', 'U')	('that', 'end', 'U')	
that any fliers@#%^&*('fliers', 'end', 'U')

Mr. Steinberg had insisted@#%^&*('insisted', 'said', 'U')

But@#%^&*('But', 'unclear', 'U')

it is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. Smith has been eroded.@#%^&*('unclear', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The fight has turned ugly@#%^&*('fight', 'shattered', 'U')	('turned', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and, among pilots at least, has shattered the esprit de corps@#%^&*('among', 'turned', 'U')	('shattered', 'turned', 'U')

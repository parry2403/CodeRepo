"The impact won't be that great,"@#%^&*('great', 'said', 'U')	
said Graeme Lidgerwood of First Boston Corp.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That is in part because of the effect@#%^&*('is', 'said', 'U')	
of having to average the number of shares outstanding,@#%^&*('having', 'effect', 'U')	
she said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In addition,@#%^&*('addition', 'likely', 'U')	
Mrs. Lidgerwood said,@#%^&*('said', 'likely', 'U')	
Norfolk is likely to draw down its cash initially@#%^&*('likely', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'finance', 'U')	
to finance the purchases@#%^&*('finance', 'draw', 'U')	
and thus forfeit some interest income.@#%^&*('forfeit', 'draw', 'U')	('forfeit', 'finance', 'U')	
Longer term, however, the buy-back is expected to increase earnings, especially after 1990,@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	('especially', 'said', 'U')	('1990', 'said', 'U')	
Mrs. Lidgerwood said.@#%^&*('said', 'expected', 'U')

who want to buy the stock@#%^&*('want', 'those', 'U')	
that there is a {price} floor,"@#%^&*('is', 'buy', 'U')	('he', 'said', 'U')	
he said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"At a certain price,@#%^&*('price', 'go', 'U')	
if the management thinks@#%^&*('thinks', 'go', 'U')	('the', 'stock', 'U')

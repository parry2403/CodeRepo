The United Kingdom reports came from Dr. Patrick Toseland, head of clinical chemistry at Guy's Hospital in London.@#%^&*('came', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In a telephone interview Friday, Dr. Toseland said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the number of sudden, unexplained deaths of diabetics@#%^&*('number', '17', 'U')	('he', 'seen', 'U')	
he had seen this year@#%^&*('seen', 'diabetics', 'U')	
was 17@#%^&*('17', 'said', 'U')	
compared with just two in 1985.@#%^&*('with', '17', 'U')	('two', '17', 'U')	
At least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics@#%^&*('occurred', 'said', 'U')	('diabetics', 'switched', 'U')	
who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year,@#%^&*('switched', 'diabetics', 'U')	('he', 'said', 'U')	
he said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Dr. Solomon Sobel, director of metabolism and endrocrine drug products for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
FDA officials have discussed Dr. Toseland's findings "fairly intensively."@#%^&*('discussed', 'said', 'U')	
While there have been no reports of similar sudden unexplained deaths among diabetics in the U.S.,@#%^&*('reports', 'said', 'U')	
Dr. Sobel said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the FDA plans to examine Dr. Toseland's evidence@#%^&*('FDA', 'considering', 'U')	('plans', 'said', 'U')	
and is considering its own study here.@#%^&*('considering', 'said', 'U')	('considering', 'plans', 'U')	
Dr. Toseland, a toxicologist, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
he was preparing an article for a British forensic medical journal@#%^&*('preparing', 'said', 'U')	
raising the possibility@#%^&*('raising', 'journal', 'U')	
that the deaths may have occurred@#%^&*('occurred', 'raising', 'U')	
after human insulin blunted critical warning signs@#%^&*('insulin', 'occurred', 'U')	
indicating hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar,@#%^&*('indicating', 'blunted', 'U')	('sugar', 'preparing', 'U')	('sugar', 'article', 'U')	('sugar', 'kill', 'U')	
which can kill diabetics.@#%^&*('kill', 'sugar', 'U')	
The usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include sweating, anxiety and cramps.@#%^&*('include', 'ROOT', 'R')	
With proper warning, diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels@#%^&*('raise', 'ROOT', 'R')	
by eating sugar or sugary food.@#%^&*('eating', 'raise', 'U')	
"The anecdotal data certainly shows@#%^&*('shows', 'said', 'U')	
that some of the people were not aware of the rapid onset of hypoglycemia,"@#%^&*('aware', 'shows', 'U')	
Dr. Toseland said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Dr. Robert E. Silverman, chief of the diabetes program branch, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of 1,500 diabetics@#%^&*('shown', 'said', 'U')	('diabetics', 'been', 'U')	
that has been under way at NIH for five years.@#%^&*('been', 'diabetics', 'U')	
However, he said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
officials@#%^&*('officials', 'looking', 'U')	
conducting the study@#%^&*('conducting', 'officials', 'U')	
hadn't been looking for signs of problems@#%^&*('looking', 'said', 'U')	
related to hypoglycemia unawareness.@#%^&*('related', 'problems', 'U')	
"We are now monitoring for it much more closely,"@#%^&*('monitoring', 'said', 'U')	
he said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"We do know@#%^&*('do', 'said', 'U')	
there are slight differences in the way@#%^&*('are', 'know', 'U')	
human and animal insulins drive down blood sugar,"@#%^&*('drive', 'way', 'U')	
Dr. Sobel said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The human-based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner@#%^&*('drug', 'drives', 'U')	('starts', 'said', 'U')	
and drives it down faster,@#%^&*('drives', 'starts', 'U')	('drives', 'said', 'U')	
he said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"But we don't believe@#%^&*('believe', 'said', 'U')	
there is enough of a difference@#%^&*('is', 'believe', 'U')	
to be clinically significant,"@#%^&*('significant', 'is', 'U')	
Dr. Sobel said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Reports of Dr. Toseland's findings in the British press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there.@#%^&*('triggered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Both the British Diabetic Association and the Committee on Safety in Medicines@#%^&*('Association', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- Britain's equivalent of the U.S. FDA --@#%^&*('equivalent', 'Association', 'U')	
recently issued statements@#%^&*('statements', 'Association', 'U')	
noting the lack of hard scientific evidence@#%^&*('noting', 'statements', 'U')	
to support Dr. Toseland's findings.@#%^&*('support', 'noting', 'U')	
On Friday, the American Diabetes Association issued a similar statement@#%^&*('issued', 'ROOT', 'R')	
urging the six million U.S. diabetics not to overreact to the British report.@#%^&*('urging', 'statement', 'U')	
"A loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem@#%^&*('problem', 'unlikely', 'U')	('problem', 'due', 'U')	('problem', 'said', 'U')	('is', 'unlikely', 'U')	
that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used,"@#%^&*('unlikely', 'problem', 'U')	('the', 'association', 'U')	
the American association said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The FDA already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products@#%^&*('requires', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced with human insulin than with animal-based products.@#%^&*('pronounced', 'include', 'U')	
Eli Lilly & Co., the Indianapolis-based drug manufacturer, dominates the U.S. human insulin market with its product@#%^&*('dominates', 'ROOT', 'R')

Dr. Leigh Thompson, a Lilly group vice president, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the company's clinical trials of both its animal and human-based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product.@#%^&*('indicated', 'said', 'U')	
Dr. Toseland said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
most of the British diabetics@#%^&*('most', 'taking', 'U')	('diabetics', 'died', 'U')	
who died@#%^&*('died', 'diabetics', 'U')	
had been taking a human-based insulin@#%^&*('taking', 'said', 'U')

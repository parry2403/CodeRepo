In Bombay stock market circles, the buzzword is "mega."@#%^&*('mega', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At least 40 companies are coming to the capital market@#%^&*('companies', 'raise', 'U')	('coming', 'thought', 'U')	('to', 'raise', 'U')	
to raise $6 billion, an amount@#%^&*('raise', 'coming', 'U')	('amount', 'thought', 'U')	
never thought possible in India.@#%^&*('thought', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"When they talk mega-issues,@#%^&*('talk', 'talking', 'U')	('they', 'talking', 'U')	
they're truly talking mega,"@#%^&*('talking', 'says', 'U')	
says S.A. Dave, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"The capital market is booming."@#%^&*('booming', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the mega-issues are raising megaquestions about the rapidly evolving Indian capital market.@#%^&*('raising', 'ROOT', 'R')	
One is whether there is enough money@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to fund the new issues@#%^&*('fund', 'money', 'U')	
without depressing stock trading.@#%^&*('trading', 'fund', 'U')	
Moreover, in the relatively unregulated Indian stock markets, investors frequently don't know@#%^&*('know', 'ROOT', 'R')	
what they are getting@#%^&*('getting', 'know', 'U')	
when they subscribe to an issue.@#%^&*('subscribe', 'getting', 'U')	
A prospectus in India doesn't always tell a potential investor much.@#%^&*('tell', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Some of the large amounts are being raised by small firms.@#%^&*('raised', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In addition,@#%^&*('addition', 'have', 'U')	
once money is raised,@#%^&*('raised', 'have', 'U')	
investors usually have no way@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	
of knowing@#%^&*('knowing', 'way', 'U')	
how it is spent.@#%^&*('spent', 'knowing', 'U')	
Some analysts are concerned@#%^&*('concerned', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the mega-issues, in such an unregulated environment, could lead to a mega-crash.@#%^&*('lead', 'concerned', 'U')	
"The rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects,"@#%^&*('more', 'says', 'U')	
says G.S. Patel, a former chairman of the giant, government-run mutual fund, the Unit Trust of India.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"They're going to have mega-problems."@#%^&*('going', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Indian stock markets have been on a five-year high, with dips and corrections,@#%^&*('been', 'ROOT', 'R')	
since Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi started liberalizing industry.@#%^&*('started', 'been', 'U')	
But the last stock market boom, in 1986, seems small@#%^&*('seems', 'ROOT', 'R')	
compared with the current rush to market.@#%^&*('with', 'seems', 'U')	('rush', 'seems', 'U')	
The $6 billion@#%^&*('$', 'compares', 'U')	
that some 40 companies are looking to raise in the year@#%^&*('looking', '$', 'U')	
ending March 31@#%^&*('ending', 'year', 'U')	
compares with only $2.7 billion@#%^&*('compares', 'ROOT', 'R')	
raised on the capital market in the previous fiscal year.@#%^&*('raised', '$', 'U')	
In fiscal 1984,@#%^&*('1984', 'raised', 'U')	
before Mr. Gandhi came to power,@#%^&*('came', 'raised', 'U')	
only $810 million was raised.@#%^&*('raised', 'ROOT', 'R')	
This year's biggest issue, $570 million of convertible debentures by engineering company Larsen & Toubro Ltd., is the largest in Indian history.@#%^&*('largest', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And it isn't the only giant issue:@#%^&*('issue', 'ROOT', 'R')	
together, the top four issues will raise $1.3 billion.@#%^&*
Convertible debentures@#%^&*('debentures', 'instrument', 'U')	
-- bonds@#%^&*('bonds', 'debentures', 'U')	('bonds', 'converted', 'U')	
that can later be converted into equity shares --@#%^&*('converted', 'bonds', 'U')	('are', 'instrument', 'U')	
are the most popular instrument this year,@#%^&*('instrument', 'ROOT', 'R')	
though many companies are also selling nonconvertible bonds or equity shares.@#%^&*('selling', 'instrument', 'U')	
These mega-issues are being propelled by two factors, economic and political.@#%^&*('propelled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In the past, the socialist policies of the government strictly limited the size of new steel mills, petrochemical plants, car factories and other industrial concerns@#%^&*('limited', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'conserve', 'U')	
to conserve resources@#%^&*('conserve', 'limited', 'U')	
and restrict the profits@#%^&*('restrict', 'limited', 'U')	('restrict', 'conserve', 'U')	
businessmen could make.@#%^&*('make', 'profits', 'U')	
As a result, industry operated out of small, expensive, highly inefficient industrial units.@#%^&*('operated', 'ROOT', 'R')	
When Mr. Gandhi came to power,@#%^&*('came', 'ushered', 'U')	('he', 'ushered', 'U')	
he ushered in new rules for business.@#%^&*('ushered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
He said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside India@#%^&*('industry', 'benefit', 'U')	('build', 'said', 'U')	
and benefit from economies of scale.@#%^&*('benefit', 'said', 'U')	('benefit', 'build', 'U')	
If the output was too great for the domestic market,@#%^&*('great', 'said', 'U')	('he', 'said', 'U')	
he said,@#%^&*('said', 'export', 'U')	
companies should export.@#%^&*('export', 'ROOT', 'R')	
India's overregulated businessmen had to be persuaded,@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but they have started to think big.@#%^&*('started', 'had', 'U')	
Some of the projects@#%^&*('Some', 'fruits', 'U')	
being funded by the new issues@#%^&*('funded', 'projects', 'U')	
are the first fruits of Mr. Gandhi's policy,@#%^&*('fruits', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units@#%^&*('require', 'fruits', 'U')	
built in the past.@#%^&*('built', 'units', 'U')	
The industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market,@#%^&*('produced', 'ROOT', 'R')	('market', 'source', 'U')	
which is a far cheaper source of funds than government-controlled banks,@#%^&*('source', 'market', 'U')	
where interest rates for prime borrowers are around 16%.@#%^&*('are', 'banks', 'U')	
The second factor@#%^&*('factor', 'political', 'U')	
spurring mega-issues@#%^&*('spurring', 'factor', 'U')	('is', 'political', 'U')	
is political.@#%^&*('political', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Gandhi has called general elections for November,@#%^&*('called', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and many businessmen fear@#%^&*('fear', 'called', 'U')	
that he and his Congress (I) Party will lose.@#%^&*('lose', 'fear', 'U')	
Some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than Mr. Gandhi's, and possibly more restrictive.@#%^&*('raising', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The buoyant Bombay rumor mill also says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that some of the money@#%^&*('that', 'used', 'U')	('some', 'used', 'U')	
raised in the current spate of issues@#%^&*('raised', 'money', 'U')	
will be used as campaign donations before the elections.@#%^&*('used', 'says', 'U')	
No one admits to anything,@#%^&*('admits', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but India's industrialists have a history@#%^&*('have', 'admits', 'U')	
of making under-the-table campaign donations.@#%^&*('making', 'history', 'U')	
So far, the mega-issues are a hit with investors.@#%^&*('hit', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Earlier this year, Tata Iron & Steel Co. 's offer of $355 million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed.@#%^&*('oversubscribed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Essar Gujarat Ltd., a marine construction company, had similar success with a slightly smaller issue.@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Larsen & Toubro started accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month;@#%^&*('started', 'ROOT', 'R')	
bankers and analysts expect it to be oversubscribed.@#%^&*('expect', 'started', 'U')	
Still to come are big issues by Bindal Agro Chem Ltd., a petrochemical and agrochemical company, and Usha Rectifier Corp.@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	
(India),@#%^&*('India', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'maker', 'U')	
a semiconductor maker.@#%^&*('maker', 'India', 'U')	
While many investors are selling parts of their portfolios@#%^&*('selling', 'holding', 'U')	('to', 'buy', 'U')	
to buy the new issues,@#%^&*('buy', 'portfolios', 'U')	
prices on India's 16 stock exchanges are holding up so far.@#%^&*('holding', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"I don't think@#%^&*('think', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market,"@#%^&*('lead', 'think', 'U')	
says Mr. Patel,@#%^&*('says', 'think', 'U')	
"only a sagging tendency."@#%^&*('only', 'think', 'U')	
Says M.J. Pherwani, chairman of the Unit Trust of India:@#%^&*('Says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The "markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before."@#%^&*('headed', 'Says', 'U')	
But with growth come growing pains,@#%^&*('come', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and never has this been clearer on the Indian capital market than now.@#%^&*('clearer', 'come', 'U')	
In the past, the government controlled the markets indirectly, through its tight grip on industry itself.@#%^&*('controlled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Various ministries decided the products@#%^&*('decided', 'ROOT', 'R')	
businessmen could produce@#%^&*('produce', 'products', 'U')	
and how much;@#%^&*('much', 'decided', 'U')	('much', 'products', 'U')	
and government-owned banks controlled the financing of projects@#%^&*('banks', 'monitored', 'U')	('controlled', 'decided', 'U')	
and monitored@#%^&*('monitored', 'decided', 'U')	('monitored', 'controlled', 'U')	
whether companies came through on promised plans.@#%^&*('came', 'monitored', 'U')	
The government has been content with this far-reaching, subtle form of control,@#%^&*('content', 'ROOT', 'R')	
exercised on a case-by-case basis with no clear rules or guidelines.@#%^&*('exercised', 'form', 'U')	
But now,@#%^&*('But', 'has', 'U')	('now', 'has', 'U')	
with large amounts being raised from investors,@#%^&*('amounts', 'has', 'U')	
the government's dawdling on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect.@#%^&*('has', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Securities and Exchange Board of India was set up earlier this year, along the lines of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,@#%^&*('set', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but New Delhi hasn't pushed the legislation@#%^&*('pushed', 'set', 'U')	
to make it operational.@#%^&*('make', 'legislation', 'U')	
Mr. Dave, its head, acts cheery and patient,@#%^&*('acts', 'ROOT', 'R')	('he', 'makes', 'U')	
but he makes no bones about the need@#%^&*('makes', 'acts', 'U')	
to get to work.@#%^&*('get', 'need', 'U')	
"Mega or non-mega,@#%^&*('Mega', 'feel', 'U')	('non', 'feel', 'U')	
we feel@#%^&*('feel', 'says', 'U')	
the prospectus standards need to be considerably improved,"@#%^&*('need', 'feel', 'U')	('he', 'says', 'U')	
he says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Disclosures are very poor in India."@#%^&*('poor', 'ROOT', 'R')	
He says@#%^&*('says', 'asked', 'U')	('says', 'asked', 'U')	
the big questions@#%^&*('questions', 'says', 'U')	
-- "Do you really need this much money@#%^&*('need', 'questions', 'U')	
to put up these investments?@#%^&*('put', 'need', 'U')	
Have you told investors@#%^&*('told', 'need', 'U')	('investors', 'happening', 'U')	
what is happening in your sector?@#%^&*('happening', 'investors', 'U')	
What about your track record? -- "@#%^&*('What', 'need', 'U')	
aren't asked of companies@#%^&*('asked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
coming to market.@#%^&*('coming', 'companies', 'U')	
Instead,@#%^&*('Instead', 'have', 'U')	
he says,@#%^&*('says', 'have', 'U')	
most investors have to rely on the rumor-happy Indian press.@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	
An example is the biggest offering of them all, Larsen & Toubro's $570 million bond issue.@#%^&*('offering', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The engineering company was acquired in a takeover earlier this year by the giant Reliance textile group.@#%^&*('acquired', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Although Larsen & Toubro hadn't raised money from the public in 38 years,@#%^&*
its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market.@#%^&*('raise', 'ROOT', 'R')	
(Reliance floated a $357 million petrochemical company in 1988@#%^&*('floated', 'ROOT', 'R')	('1988', 'was', 'U')	
that was, at the time, the largest public issue in Indian history.)@#%^&*('was', '1988', 'U')	('issue', '1988', 'U')	
The media has raised questions about Larsen & Toubro's issue,@#%^&*('raised', '1988', 'U')	('questions', 'floated', 'U')	
pointing out@#%^&*('pointing', 'floated', 'U')	
that it exceeds the company's annual sales and its market capitalization.@#%^&*('exceeds', 'pointing', 'U')	
Even stranger is the case of Usha Rectifier, a semiconductor company with 1988 sales of $28 million@#%^&*('case', 'ROOT', 'R')	('company', 'raising', 'U')	
that's raising $270 million@#%^&*('raising', 'company', 'U')	
to build an iron plant.@#%^&*('build', 'raising', 'U')	
Once the money is raised,@#%^&*('raised', 'certain', 'U')	
it isn't always certain how it is used.@#%^&*('certain', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Larsen & Toubro, for example, says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it's raising $570 million@#%^&*('raising', 'says', 'U')	
to use as supplier credit on large engineering jobs.@#%^&*('use', 'raising', 'U')	
Unlike other companies, it hasn't pin-pointed specific projects for the funds.@#%^&*('pin', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And even when specific projects are described in prospectuses,@#%^&*('And', 'used', 'U')	('described', 'used', 'U')	
the money often is used elsewhere,@#%^&*('used', 'ROOT', 'R')	
according to analysts.@#%^&*('to', 'used', 'U')	('analysts', 'used', 'U')	
"Someone must monitor@#%^&*('monitor', 'says', 'U')	
where the funds are deployed,"@#%^&*('deployed', 'monitor', 'U')	
says Mr. Dave.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Patel agrees:@#%^&*('agrees', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"There is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds.@#%^&*('is', 'agrees', 'U')	
They're trying to plug the various loopholes,@#%^&*('trying', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but they're totally unprepared for this."@#%^&*('unprepared', 'trying', 'U')	
Because of the large amounts of money@#%^&*('amounts', 'fear', 'U')	
being raised,@#%^&*('raised', 'money', 'U')	
the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring@#%^&*('requirements', 'amounts', 'U')	('requirements', 'money', 'U')	('monitoring', 'amounts', 'U')	('monitoring', 'money', 'U')	
of how the money is used,@#%^&*('used', 'monitoring', 'U')	
some analysts fear@#%^&*('fear', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that there could be a few mega-crashes,@#%^&*('mega', 'fear', 'U')	('mega', 'hurt', 'U')	('could', 'hurt', 'U')	
which could hurt market confidence far more than the small bankruptcies@#%^&*('hurt', 'mega', 'U')	('bankruptcies', 'followed', 'U')	
that followed the boom of 1986.@#%^&*('followed', 'bankruptcies', 'U')	
The government insists@#%^&*('insists', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that such a possibility is low.@#%^&*('low', 'insists', 'U')	
It says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that@#%^&*('that', 'prevent', 'U')	
despite loose regulation of the market itself,@#%^&*('regulation', 'prevent', 'U')	
its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes.@#%^&*('prevent', 'says', 'U')

Congress sent to President Bush an $8.5 billion military construction bill@#%^&*('sent', 'ROOT', 'R')	('bill', 'cuts', 'U')	
that cuts spending for new installations by 16%@#%^&*('cuts', 'bill', 'U')	('%', 'while', 'U')	
while revamping the Pentagon budget@#%^&*('revamping', 'sent', 'U')	('budget', 'move', 'U')	
to move more than $450 million from foreign bases to home-state projects.@#%^&*('move', 'revamping', 'U')	
The fiscal 1990 measure builds on a pattern@#%^&*('builds', 'ROOT', 'R')	
set earlier this year by House and Senate defense authorizing committees,@#%^&*('set', 'pattern', 'U')	('at', 'builds', 'U')	('a', 'time', 'U')	
and@#%^&*('time', 'at', 'U')	
-- at a time of retrenchment for the military and concern about the U.S.'s standing in the world economy --@#%^&*
overseas spending is most vulnerable.@#%^&*('vulnerable', 'builds', 'U')	('vulnerable', 'builds', 'U')	
Total Pentagon requests for installations in West Germany, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the Philippines, for example, are cut by almost two-thirds,@#%^&*('cut', 'ROOT', 'R')	
while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home.@#%^&*('added', 'cut', 'U')	
The result is that instead of the Pentagon's proposed split of 60-40 between domestic and foreign bases, the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately 70-30.@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The extra margin for bases in the U.S. enhances the power of the appropriations committees;@#%^&*('enhances', 'ROOT', 'R')	
meanwhile, lawmakers used their positions@#%^&*('used', 'enhances', 'U')	
to garner as much@#%^&*('garner', 'used', 'U')	('as', 'times', 'U')	
as six times what the Pentagon had requested for their individual states.@#%^&*('requested', 'garner', 'U')	
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten@#%^&*('Whitten', 'helped', 'U')	
(D., Miss.)@#%^&*('D.', 'Whitten', 'U')	
helped secure $49.7 million for his state, or more than double the Pentagon's budget.@#%^&*('helped', 'ROOT', 'R')	
West Virginia, home of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, would receive $21.5 million@#%^&*('receive', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- four times the military's request.@#%^&*('request', '$', 'U')	
Tennessee and North Carolina, home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees, receive $243.2 million, or 25% above the Pentagon's request.@#%^&*('receive', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Though spending for Iowa and Oregon was far less,@#%^&*('less', 'greater', 'U')	
their increases above Pentagon requests@#%^&*('increases', 'greater', 'U')	
-- 640% and 430%, respectively --@#%^&*('%', 'increases', 'U')	('%', 'increases', 'U')	
were much greater@#%^&*('greater', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because of the influence of Republicans at critical junctures.@#%^&*('influence', 'greater', 'U')	('junctures', 'greater', 'U')	
The swift passage of the bill,@#%^&*('passage', 'cleared', 'U')	('passage', 'contrasts', 'U')	
which cleared the Senate and House on simple voice votes last week,@#%^&*('cleared', 'passage', 'U')	
contrasts with the problems@#%^&*('contrasts', 'ROOT', 'R')	('problems', 'facing', 'U')	
still facing a more cumbersome $66.8 billion measure@#%^&*('facing', 'contrasts', 'U')	
funding housing, environmental, space and veterans programs.@#%^&*('funding', 'measure', 'U')	
By an 84-6 margin, the Senate approved the bulk of the spending Friday,@#%^&*('approved', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'bill', 'U')	
but the bill was then sent back to the House@#%^&*('bill', 'resolve', 'U')	('sent', 'approved', 'U')	('to', 'resolve', 'U')	
to resolve the question@#%^&*('resolve', 'sent', 'U')	
of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the Federal Housing Administration.@#%^&*('address', 'question', 'U')	
The House Democratic leadership could seek to waive these restrictions,@#%^&*('seek', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'bill', 'U')	
but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere.@#%^&*('is', 'seek', 'U')	
Appropriations committees have used an assortment of devices@#%^&*('used', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to disguise as much as $1 billion in spending,@#%^&*('disguise', 'used', 'U')	('as', 'awakened', 'U')	
and@#%^&*('critics', 'awakened', 'U')	
as critics have awakened to these devices,@#%^&*('awakened', 'seem', 'U')	('the', 'bill', 'U')	
the bill can seem like a wounded caribou@#%^&*('seem', 'used', 'U')	
trying to make it past ice and wolves@#%^&*('trying', 'caribou', 'U')	('to', 'reach', 'U')	
to reach safer winter grazing.@#%^&*('reach', 'make', 'U')	
Much of the excess spending will be pushed into fiscal 1991,@#%^&*('Much', 'parked', 'U')	('pushed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and in some cases is temporarily parked in slow-spending accounts in anticipation@#%^&*('parked', 'pushed', 'U')

after the budget scorekeeping is completed.@#%^&*('completed', 'transferred', 'U')	
For example, a House-Senate conference ostensibly increased the National Aeronautics and Space Administration budget for construction of facilities to nearly $592 million, or more than $200 million above what either chamber had previously approved.@#%^&*('increased', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Part of the increase would provide $90 million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid rocket-motor facility in Mr. Whitten's Mississippi.@#%^&*('provide', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But as much as $177 million, or nearly 30% of the account, is marked for potential transfers to research, management and flight accounts@#%^&*('marked', 'ROOT', 'R')	('accounts', 'spent', 'U')	
that are spent out at a faster clip.@#%^&*('spent', 'accounts', 'U')	
The bill's managers face criticism, too, for the unusual number of conditions@#%^&*('face', 'ROOT', 'R')	
openly imposed on where funds will be spent.@#%^&*('imposed', 'conditions', 'U')	
Conservatives,@#%^&*('Conservatives', 'used', 'U')

HUD Secretary Jack Kemp backed an unsuccessful effort@#%^&*('Kemp', 'received', 'U')	('backed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to strike such language@#%^&*('strike', 'backed', 'U')

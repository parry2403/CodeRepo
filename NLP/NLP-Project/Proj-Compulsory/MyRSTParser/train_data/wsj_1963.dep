before the negotiations with the Senate began.@#%^&*('began', 'reduce', 'U')

it is conditioned on their desire@#%^&*('conditioned', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to see them passed in another form."@#%^&*('see', 'desire', 'U')	
Now those items will be discussed in a House-Senate conference,@#%^&*('discussed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('conference', 'begin', 'U')	
which could begin as soon as today,@#%^&*('begin', 'conference', 'U')	('today', 'discussed', 'U')

"You've got to give these chairmen the opportunity@#%^&*('got', 'said', 'U')	('to', 'see', 'U')	
to see@#%^&*('see', 'opportunity', 'U')	
if they can work things out,"@#%^&*('work', 'see', 'U')	
said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')

to keep the capital-gains provision in the final version of the bill@#%^&*('keep', 'press', 'U')

that wasn't likely.@#%^&*('likely', 'said', 'U')	
Failure@#%^&*('Failure', 'meant', 'U')	
to pass the bill@#%^&*('pass', 'Failure', 'U')	
meant that $16.1 billion in across-the-board spending cuts took effect Monday under the Gramm-Rudman budget law.@#%^&*('meant', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The bill must be enacted@#%^&*('enacted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
before the cuts can be restored.@#%^&*('restored', 'enacted', 'U')

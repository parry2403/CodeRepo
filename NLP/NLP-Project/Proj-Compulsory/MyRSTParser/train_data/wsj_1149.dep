The Justice Department is in the process@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
of trying to gain control over a law@#%^&*('trying', 'process', 'U')	
that federal Judge David Sentelle recently called a "monster."@#%^&*('called', 'gain', 'U')	
Needless to say,@#%^&*('Needless', 'talking', 'U')	
he was talking about RICO.@#%^&*('talking', 'ROOT', 'R')	
With its recently revised guidelines for RICO,@#%^&*('guidelines', 'makes', 'U')	
Justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors.@#%^&*('makes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The text of the "new policy" guidelines from the Criminal Division are reprinted nearby.@#%^&*('reprinted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
They strongly suggest@#%^&*('suggest', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Justice's prosecutions of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Michael Milken and Princeton/Newport violated notions of fundamental fairness.@#%^&*('violated', 'suggest', 'U')	
Justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics.@#%^&*('attempting', 'ROOT', 'R')	
This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani,@#%^&*('amounts', 'ROOT', 'R')	('candidate', 'inclined', 'U')	('Giuliani', 'inclined', 'U')	
who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets.@#%^&*('inclined', 'candidate', 'U')	
The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors, clients, bankers and others.@#%^&*('limit', 'ROOT', 'R')	
This follows earlier new guidelines from the Tax Division@#%^&*('follows', 'ROOT', 'R')	
prohibiting Princeton/Newport-like tax cases from masquerading as RICO cases.@#%^&*('prohibiting', 'Division', 'U')	
The forfeiture memo cited "considerable criticism in the press,@#%^&*('cited', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'perception', 'U')	
because of a perception@#%^&*('perception', 'cited', 'U')	
that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property@#%^&*('tantamount', 'perception', 'U')	
without due process."@#%^&*('process', 'cited', 'U')	
It told prosecutors not to seek forfeitures@#%^&*('told', 'ROOT', 'R')	('forfeitures', 'are', 'U')	
if there are "less intrusive" alternatives, such as bonds,@#%^&*('are', 'seek', 'U')	('alternatives', 'seek', 'U')	
and in any case not to seek forfeitures "disproportionate to the defendant's crime."@#%^&*('seek', 'are', 'U')	
These changes come a tad late for Princeton/Newport, the first RICOed securities firm.@#%^&*('come', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It was forced into liquidation before trial@#%^&*('forced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when investors yanked their funds@#%^&*('yanked', 'forced', 'U')	
after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture.@#%^&*('demanded', 'yanked', 'U')	
Princeton/Newport investors,@#%^&*('investors', 'made', 'U')	
including McKinsey & Co. and the Harvard endowment,@#%^&*('McKinsey', 'investors', 'U')	('Co.', 'investors', 'U')	('endowment', 'investors', 'U')	
made the rational decision@#%^&*('made', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to withdraw their money;@#%^&*('withdraw', 'made', 'U')	('the', 'firm', 'U')	
for the firm, the liquidation was sentence first, verdict later.@#%^&*('sentence', 'made', 'U')	
Prosecutors wanted $23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $400,000.@#%^&*('wanted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The experience of Princeton/Newport and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel@#%^&*('taught', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank.@#%^&*('bank', 'taught', 'U')	
Drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement@#%^&*('agreed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
allowing it to plea to charges@#%^&*('allowing', 'agreed', 'U')	('charges', 'is', 'U')	
"which the company is not in a position@#%^&*('is', 'charges', 'U')	
to dispute"@#%^&*('dispute', 'position', 'U')	
because of RICO.@#%^&*('RICO', 'dispute', 'U')	
Part of Drexel's plea was to cut Mr. Milken loose.@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	
So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what, if anything, Drexel did wrong.@#%^&*('established', 'ROOT', 'R')	
So two cheers for the new rules.@#%^&*('So', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Justice has finally recognized its employees' abuses, thanks largely to the demands for reform by former U.S. attorney in Washington Joseph diGenova,@#%^&*('recognized', 'ROOT', 'R')	('demands', 'wants', 'U')	('demands', 'salvage', 'U')	
who wants to salvage RICO for real criminals.@#%^&*('wants', 'demands', 'U')	
But prosecutorial guidelines are effective@#%^&*('effective', 'ROOT', 'R')	
only if someone at Justice is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors.@#%^&*('willing', 'effective', 'U')	('able', 'effective', 'U')	
Judge Sentelle, of the appeals court in Washington, made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech@#%^&*('made', 'ROOT', 'R')	
titled, "RICO:@#%^&*('titled', 'speech', 'U')	('RICO', 'Ate', 'U')	
The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence."@#%^&*('Monster', 'RICO', 'U')	('Ate', 'RICO', 'U')	
He said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
ours is supposed to be "a government of laws not of men,"@#%^&*('supposed', 'said', 'U')	
and yet RICO defenders "tell us@#%^&*('tell', 'said', 'U')	
that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion@#%^&*('we', 'protect', 'U')	('rely', 'tell', 'U')	('to', 'protect', 'U')	
to protect against overbreadth of RICO."@#%^&*('protect', 'rely', 'U')	
No prosecutorial guidelines,@#%^&*('guidelines', 'limit', 'U')	
observed or unobserved,@#%^&*('observed', 'guidelines', 'U')	('unobserved', 'guidelines', 'U')	
limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages.@#%^&*('limit', 'ROOT', 'R')	
What now for Princeton/Newport officials, Drexel and Mr. Milken?@#%^&*('for', 'review', 'U')	('Drexel', 'review', 'U')	('Mr.', 'Justice', 'U')	('Milken', 'Justice', 'U')	
Justice should review these cases@#%^&*('Justice', 'Drexel', 'U')	('review', 'ROOT', 'R')	('cases', 'see', 'U')	
to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred.@#%^&*('see', 'review', 'U')	
We suspect@#%^&*('suspect', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Justice will some day agree@#%^&*('agree', 'suspect', 'U')	('that', 'guarantee', 'U')	
that only the complete repeal of RICO can guarantee an end to injustices in its name.@#%^&*('guarantee', 'agree', 'U')

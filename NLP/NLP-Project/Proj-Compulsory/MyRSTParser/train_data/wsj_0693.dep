that the Bank of Japan was seen unloading dollars around 142.70 yen.@#%^&*('seen', 'gaining', 'U')

the dollar was dragged down,@#%^&*('dragged', 'ROOT', 'R')

While some analysts say@#%^&*('say', 'see', 'U')	
the dollar eventually could test support at 1.75 marks and 135 yen,@#%^&*('test', 'say', 'U')	
Mr. Scalfaro and others don't see the currency decisively sliding under support at 1.80 marks and 140 yen soon.@#%^&*('see', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound's weak state after Mr. Lawson's resignation and the yen's inability@#%^&*('Predictions', 'strengthen', 'U')	('based', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to strengthen substantially@#%^&*('strengthen', 'based', 'U')

But the market remains uneasy about Mr. Major's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound,@#%^&*('remains', 'contend', 'U')	
currency analysts contend.@#%^&*('contend', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Although the Bank of England's tight monetary policy has fueled worries@#%^&*('fueled', 'believed', 'U')	
that Britain's slowing economy is headed for a recession,@#%^&*('headed', 'fueled', 'U')	('it', 'believed', 'U')	('is', 'believed', 'U')	
it is widely believed that Mr. Lawson's willingness@#%^&*('believed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('that', 'helped', 'U')	('willingness', 'helped', 'U')	
to prop up the pound with interest-rate increases@#%^&*('prop', 'willingness', 'U')	
helped stem pound selling in recent weeks.@#%^&*('helped', 'believed', 'U')	
If there are any signs@#%^&*('are', 'expected', 'U')	
that Mr. Major will be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts@#%^&*('inclined', 'are', 'U')	('to', 'rescue', 'U')	
to rescue the pound from another plunge,@#%^&*('rescue', 'use', 'U')	
that currency is expected to fall sharply.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')

but he adds@#%^&*('adds', 'says', 'U')	
that near-term losses may be small@#%^&*('small', 'adds', 'U')	
because the selling wave@#%^&*('wave', 'small', 'U')	('wave', 'followed', 'U')	
that followed Mr. Major's appointment@#%^&*('followed', 'wave', 'U')	('appointment', 'run', 'U')	
apparently has run its course.@#%^&*('run', 'followed', 'U')	
But some other analysts have a stormier forecast for the pound,@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	
particularly because Britain's inflation is hovering at a relatively lofty annual rate of about 7.6%@#%^&*('hovering', 'have', 'U')	
and the nation is burdened with a struggling government and large current account and trade deficits.@#%^&*('burdened', 'have', 'U')	('burdened', 'hovering', 'U')	
The pound likely will fall in coming days@#%^&*('pound', 'trade', 'U')	('fall', 'says', 'U')

says Nigel Rendell, an international economist at James Capel & Co. in London.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The pound was at 2.8896 marks late Friday, off sharply from 2.9511 in New York trading a week earlier.@#%^&*('Friday', 'ROOT', 'R')	
If the pound falls closer to 2.80 marks,@#%^&*('falls', 'raise', 'U')	('the', 'Bank', 'U')	
the Bank of England may raise Britain's base lending rate by one percentage point to 16%,@#%^&*('raise', 'says', 'U')	
says Mr. Rendell.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But such an increase,@#%^&*('But', 'viewed', 'U')	('increase', 'viewed', 'U')	
he says,@#%^&*('says', 'viewed', 'U')	
could be viewed by the market as "too little too late."@#%^&*('viewed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Bank of England indicated its desire@#%^&*('indicated', 'say', 'U')	
to leave its monetary policy unchanged Friday@#%^&*('leave', 'indicated', 'U')	('unchanged', 'indicated', 'U')	('Friday', 'indicated', 'U')	
by declining to raise the official 15% discount-borrowing rate@#%^&*('declining', 'indicated', 'U')	
that it charges discount houses,@#%^&*('charges', 'raise', 'U')	
analysts say.@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Pound concerns aside, the lack of strong buying interest in the yen is another boon for the dollar,@#%^&*('boon', 'say', 'U')	
many traders say.@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The dollar has a "natural base of support" around 140 yen@#%^&*('has', 'says', 'U')	
because the Japanese currency hasn't been purchased heavily in recent weeks,@#%^&*
says Ms. Soares-Kemp of Credit Suisse.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The yen's softness,@#%^&*('softness', 'stems', 'U')	('softness', 'purchase', 'U')	
she says,@#%^&*('says', 'stems', 'U')	
apparently stems from Japanese investors' interest@#%^&*('stems', 'ROOT', 'R')	
in buying dollars against the yen@#%^&*('dollars', 'interest', 'U')	
to purchase U.S. bond issues@#%^&*('purchase', 'stems', 'U')

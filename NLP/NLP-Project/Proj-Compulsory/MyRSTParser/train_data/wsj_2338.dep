General Motors Corp., in a series of moves@#%^&*('Corp.', 'signaled', 'U')	('moves', 'angered', 'U')	
that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada,@#%^&*('angered', 'moves', 'U')	
has signaled@#%^&*('signaled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s@#%^&*('survive', 'signaled', 'U')	('as', 'struggles', 'U')	('the', 'corporation', 'U')	
as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity.@#%^&*('struggles', 'survive', 'U')	
In announcements to workers late last week, GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants,@#%^&*('GM', 'cast', 'U')	('signed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories.@#%^&*('cast', 'signed', 'U')	
GM is under intense pressure@#%^&*('GM', 'close', 'U')	('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to close factories@#%^&*('close', 'is', 'U')	('factories', 'became', 'U')	
that became unprofitable@#%^&*('became', 'factories', 'U')	('unprofitable', 'skidded', 'U')	
as the giant auto maker's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade.@#%^&*('share', 'unprofitable', 'U')	('skidded', 'became', 'U')	
The company,@#%^&*('company', 'vowed', 'U')	
currently using about 80% of its North American vehicle capacity,@#%^&*('using', 'company', 'U')	
has vowed@#%^&*('vowed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it will run at 100% of capacity by 1992.@#%^&*('run', 'vowed', 'U')	
Just a month ago, GM announced@#%^&*('announced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood, Ga., the eighth U.S. assembly facility@#%^&*('make', 'announced', 'U')	
to close since 1987.@#%^&*('close', 'make', 'U')	
Now, GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation@#%^&*('appears', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'get', 'U')	
to get in shape for the 1990s.@#%^&*('get', 'stepping', 'U')	
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S.@#%^&*('competition', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower@#%^&*('pouring', 'ROOT', 'R')	('than', 'match', 'U')	
than GM can match.@#%^&*('match', 'lower', 'U')	
Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract@#%^&*('want', 'signaled', 'U')	('contract', 'negotiated', 'U')	
that will be negotiated next year.@#%^&*('negotiated', 'contract', 'U')	
GM officials want to get their strategy@#%^&*('want', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'reduce', 'U')	
to reduce capacity and the work force@#%^&*('reduce', 'strategy', 'U')	
in place@#%^&*('place', 'reduce', 'U')	
before those talks begin.@#%^&*('begin', 'reduce', 'U')	
The problem, however, is that GM's moves are coming at a time@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents@#%^&*('trying', 'coming', 'U')	('dissidents', 'charge', 'U')	
who charge@#%^&*('charge', 'dissidents', 'U')	
the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs.@#%^&*('passive', 'charge', 'U')	
Against that backdrop, UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich,@#%^&*('backdrop', 'issued', 'U')	('Yokich', 'became', 'U')	('Yokich', 'issued', 'U')	
who recently became head of the union's GM department,@#%^&*('became', 'Yokich', 'U')	
issued a statement Friday@#%^&*('issued', 'ROOT', 'R')	
blasting GM's "flagrant insensitivity" toward union members.@#%^&*('blasting', 'issued', 'U')	
The auto maker's decision@#%^&*('decision', 'showed', 'U')	('to', 'let', 'U')	
to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants@#%^&*('let', 'decision', 'U')	
showed "disarray" and an "inability or unwillingness@#%^&*('showed', 'said', 'U')	('disarray', 'provide', 'U')	('inability', 'provide', 'U')	
to provide consistent information,"@#%^&*('provide', 'showed', 'U')	
Mr. Yokich said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves:@#%^&*('told', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint, Mich.@#%^&*('consolidated', 'told', 'U')	
That means two plants@#%^&*('means', 'ROOT', 'R')	('plants', 'shut', 'U')	
-- one in Scarborough, Ontario, and the other in Lordstown, Ohio --@#%^&*('one', 'plants', 'U')	('other', 'plants', 'U')	
probably will be shut down after the end of 1991.@#%^&*('shut', 'means', 'U')	
The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio.@#%^&*('idle', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Robert White, Canadian Auto Workers union president, used the impending Scarborough shutdown@#%^&*('used', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'criticize', 'U')	
to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.@#%^&*('criticize', 'used', 'U')	
But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move@#%^&*('benefit', 'ROOT', 'R')	('move', 'affects', 'U')	
that affects three U.S. car plants and one in Quebec.@#%^&*('affects', 'move', 'U')	
Workers at plants in Van Nuys, Calif., Oklahoma City and Pontiac, Mich., were told@#%^&*('told', 'ROOT', 'R')	
their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars.@#%^&*('considered', 'told', 'U')	
GM is studying@#%^&*('studying', 'said', 'U')	
whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese, Quebec,@#%^&*('build', 'studying', 'U')	
company and union officials said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures.@#%^&*('left', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Van Nuys plant,@#%^&*('plant', 'employs', 'U')	('plant', 'have', 'U')	
which employs about 3,000 workers,@#%^&*('employs', 'plant', 'U')	
doesn't have a product@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to build after 1993.@#%^&*('build', 'product', 'U')	
Jerry Shrieves, UAW local president, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the facility was asked to draw up plans@#%^&*('asked', 'said', 'U')	('to', 'continue', 'U')	
to continue working as a "flex plant,"@#%^&*('continue', 'plans', 'U')	('plant', 'build', 'U')	
which could build several different types of products on short notice@#%^&*('build', 'plant', 'U')	
to satisfy demand.@#%^&*('satisfy', 'build', 'U')	
At the Oklahoma City plant,@#%^&*('plant', 'employs', 'U')	('plant', 'said', 'U')	
which employs about 6,000 workers@#%^&*('employs', 'plant', 'U')	
building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars,@#%^&*('building', 'workers', 'U')	
Steve Featherston, UAW local vice president, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'plant', 'U')	
the plant has no new product@#%^&*('has', 'said', 'U')	
lined up,@#%^&*('lined', 'product', 'U')	
and "none of us knows"@#%^&*('knows', 'said', 'U')	('knows', 'has', 'U')	
when the A-body cars will die.@#%^&*('die', 'said', 'U')	
He said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
he believes@#%^&*('believes', 'said', 'U')	
GM has plans@#%^&*('GM', 'keep', 'U')	('plans', 'believes', 'U')	
to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s.@#%^&*('keep', 'plans', 'U')	
At Pontiac, however, the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes@#%^&*('appears', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant@#%^&*('reopen', 'hopes', 'U')	('plant', 'built', 'U')	
that last built the plastic-bodied, two-seater Pontiac Fiero model.@#%^&*('built', 'plant', 'U')	
The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at GM@#%^&*('viewed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year.@#%^&*('forced', 'viewed', 'U')	
Union officials have taken a beating politically as a result.@#%^&*('taken', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Dissident UAW members have used the Fiero plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation's failure.@#%^&*('used', 'ROOT', 'R')

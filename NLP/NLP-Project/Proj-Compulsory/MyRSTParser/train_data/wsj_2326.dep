The Bush administration,@#%^&*('administration', 'questioning', 'U')	
trying to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc,@#%^&*('trying', 'administration', 'U')	
is questioning@#%^&*('questioning', 'ROOT', 'R')	
whether Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. supplied militarily valuable technology to the Soviets.@#%^&*('militarily', 'questioning', 'U')	
Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, the unofficial forum@#%^&*('Most', 'expected', 'U')	('Most', 'argue', 'U')	('forum', 'align', 'U')	('the', 'U.S.', 'U')

to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26.@#%^&*('held', 'meeting', 'U')

governing exports of machine tools, computers and other high-technology products.@#%^&*('exports', 'relaxation', 'U')	
But the Bush administration says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it wants to see evidence@#%^&*('wants', 'says', 'U')	
that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures@#%^&*('complying', 'see', 'U')	
before it will support further liberalization.@#%^&*('support', 'complying', 'U')	
To make its point,@#%^&*('make', 'challenging', 'U')	('it', 'challenging', 'U')	
it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports@#%^&*('challenging', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices@#%^&*('supplied', 'explain', 'U')	('devices', 'used', 'U')	('devices', 'build', 'U')	
that could be used@#%^&*('used', 'devices', 'U')	
to build parts for combat aircraft.@#%^&*('build', 'used', 'U')	
The London Sunday Times,@#%^&*('Times', 'reported', 'U')	('Times', 'cited', 'U')	
which first reported the U.S. concerns,@#%^&*('reported', 'Times', 'U')	
cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations@#%^&*('cited', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Olivetti exported $25 million in "embargoed, state-of-the-art, flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry."@#%^&*('exported', 'cited', 'U')	
Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984.@#%^&*('began', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A State Department spokesman acknowledged@#%^&*('spokesman', 'declined', 'U')	('spokesman', 'confirm', 'U')	('acknowledged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom,@#%^&*('discussing', 'acknowledged', 'U')	
but declined to confirm any details.@#%^&*('declined', 'acknowledged', 'U')	
Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation@#%^&*('promised', 'ROOT', 'R')	
into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules.@#%^&*('broke', 'promised', 'U')	
President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader's visit here last week.@#%^&*('called', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Olivetti has denied@#%^&*('denied', 'ROOT', 'R')

asserting@#%^&*('asserting', 'violated', 'U')	
that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities.@#%^&*('licensed', 'asserting', 'U')	
Although the legality of these sales is still an open question,@#%^&*('question', 'timed', 'U')	('the', 'disclosure', 'U')	
the disclosure couldn't be better timed@#%^&*('disclosure', 'support', 'U')	('timed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community.@#%^&*('support', 'timed', 'U')

The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies,@#%^&*('sent', 'ROOT', 'R')	
reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies.@#%^&*('reflecting', 'sent', 'U')	
Last summer, Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization@#%^&*('moved', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting@#%^&*('told', 'moved', 'U')	
that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods.@#%^&*('allow', 'told', 'U')	
But more recently, the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent@#%^&*('feuded', 'ROOT', 'R')	('extent', 'liberalize', 'U')	
to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc.@#%^&*('liberalize', 'extent', 'U')	
However, these agencies generally agree@#%^&*('agree', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization.@#%^&*('cautious', 'agree', 'U')	
"There's no evidence@#%^&*("'s", 'said', 'U')

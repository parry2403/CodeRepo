The 301-year-old exchange is battered by enormous claims from a decade-long run of unprecedented disasters,@#%^&*('battered', 'ROOT', 'R')	('disasters', 'recent', 'U')

Lloyd's is being squeezed out of low-margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance.@#%^&*('squeezed', 'ROOT', 'R')

Lloyd's 66% stake in that market has shrunk to 50% in that period,@#%^&*('shrunk', 'ROOT', 'R')	
according to an official at the Institute of London Underwriters, a Lloyd's competitor.@#%^&*('official', 'shrunk', 'U')

At the peak of its power and influence a century ago, Lloyd's dominated the insurance world with a 50% stake.@#%^&*('dominated', 'ROOT', 'R')

competitors now underwrite most of that business.@#%^&*('underwrite', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Beyond that, many big oil, chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market@#%^&*('siphoning', 'ROOT', 'R')

But since 1981, Kirk Horse Insurance Inc. of Lexington, Ky. has grabbed a 20% stake of the market.@#%^&*('grabbed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Ronald Kirk, president, says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Lloyd's has suffered@#%^&*('suffered', 'says', 'U')

before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters.@#%^&*('clear', 'years', 'U')	
The magnitude of the exchange's problems may not become known for some time@#%^&*('become', 'ROOT', 'R')

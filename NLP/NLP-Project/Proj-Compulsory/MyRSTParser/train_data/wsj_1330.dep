Santa Fe Pacific Corp. is preparing a plan@#%^&*('preparing', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to sell a 20% stake in its large real estate unit to a California public employee pension fund for $400 million,@#%^&*('sell', 'plan', 'U')	('fund', 'spin', 'U')	('it', 'spin', 'U')	
after which it would spin off the realty operation to shareholders.@#%^&*('spin', 'fund', 'U')	
The plan places an indicated value on the real estate operation, Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp., of $2 billion.@#%^&*('places', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Santa Fe Pacific directors are expected to review the plan at a meeting today,@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
according to people familiar with the transaction.@#%^&*('people', 'review', 'U')	
If approved,@#%^&*('approved', 'expected', 'U')	
the sale is expected to close by year's end,@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'spinoff', 'U')	
with the spinoff occurring by the end of 1992.@#%^&*('spinoff', 'expected', 'U')	
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Santa Fe Pacific closed at $20.625, down 25 cents.@#%^&*('closed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Santa Fe Pacific Realty is a major California land and building owner@#%^&*('land', 'ROOT', 'R')	('land', 'properties', 'U')	('owner', 'properties', 'U')	
whose prime properties include 1,850 undeveloped acres in the San Francisco Bay area, and several office sites.@#%^&*('include', 'land', 'U')	('sites', 'land', 'U')	
A spokesman said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the properties survived@#%^&*('survived', 'said', 'U')	
without significant damage@#%^&*('damage', 'survived', 'U')	
in last week's Northern California earthquake.@#%^&*('earthquake', 'survived', 'U')	
As a result of the partial sale and spinoff,@#%^&*('result', 'obtain', 'U')	('the', 'System', 'U')	
the $56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System would obtain two seats on the board of the real estate operation,@#%^&*('obtain', 'ROOT', 'R')	
according to officials of the fund,@#%^&*('to', 'obtain', 'U')	('officials', 'obtain', 'U')	('fund', 'described', 'U')	
who described the plan.@#%^&*('described', 'fund', 'U')	
A spokesman for Chicago-based Santa Fe Pacific confirmed@#%^&*('confirmed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that negotiations were being held with the fund.@#%^&*('held', 'confirmed', 'U')	
Also holding two seats each on the board,@#%^&*('holding', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they said,@#%^&*('said', 'holding', 'U')	('said', 'be', 'U')	
would be Olympia & York Developments Ltd.,@#%^&*('be', 'holding', 'U')	('Ltd.', 'holding', 'U')	
controlled by the Reichmann family of Canada,@#%^&*('controlled', 'Ltd.', 'U')	
and Itel Corp.,@#%^&*('Corp.', 'holding', 'U')	('Corp.', 'Ltd.', 'U')	
controlled by Chicago businessman Sam Zell.@#%^&*('controlled', 'Corp.', 'U')	
The Reichmanns and Mr. Zell, the largest holders of Santa Fe Pacific stock, have been looking for ways@#%^&*('Zell', 'raise', 'U')	('looking', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'raise', 'U')	
to raise the value of their investments,@#%^&*('raise', 'looking', 'U')	
including possible spinoffs.@#%^&*('spinoffs', 'value', 'U')	
Itel bought a 17% stake in Sante Fe Pacific last year@#%^&*('bought', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and Olympia & York later purchased about a 20% stake;@#%^&*('Olympia', 'bought', 'U')	
they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in Sante Fe Pacific.@#%^&*('have', 'bought', 'U')	
The sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase@#%^&*('phase', 'ROOT', 'R')	
of what could lead to the breakup of Santa Fe Pacific into free-standing companies for its railroad and energy operations, as well as real estate.@#%^&*('lead', 'phase', 'U')	
The debt-laden parent has been under pressure from large shareholders@#%^&*('parent', 'boost', 'U')	('been', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to boost the company's share price.@#%^&*('boost', 'been', 'U')	
At the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze.@#%^&*('caught', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The California pension fund's planned investment in the real estate unit is unusual.@#%^&*('unusual', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Pension funds rarely own as much as a 20% stake@#%^&*('own', 'ROOT', 'R')	
in what is expected to be a publicly traded company.@#%^&*('expected', 'stake', 'U')	
In addition, pension funds are rarely given seats on company boards@#%^&*('funds', 'try', 'U')	('funds', 'avoid', 'U')	('given', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and most often try to avoid them@#%^&*('try', 'given', 'U')	
because of legal concerns.@#%^&*('concerns', 'avoid', 'U')	
But fund officials said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the Santa Fe Pacific Realty investment provides an opportunity@#%^&*('provides', 'said', 'U')	
to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio@#%^&*('buy', 'opportunity', 'U')	
heavily weighted with California properties.@#%^&*('weighted', 'portfolio', 'U')	
It also marks a "major commitment to {real estate} development,@#%^&*('marks', 'said', 'U')	('development', 'involved', 'U')	
which we haven't been involved with before,"@#%^&*('involved', 'development', 'U')	
said Dale Hanson, the fund's executive director.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Under the proposed plan, the fund would also lend Santa Fe Pacific Realty $75 million in the form of a note@#%^&*('lend', 'ROOT', 'R')	('note', 'convertible', 'U')	('would', 'convertible', 'U')	
that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the then-prevailing market price.@#%^&*('convertible', 'note', 'U')	
The note would accrue interest at the rate of 13.5% a year,@#%^&*('accrue', 'ROOT', 'R')	('year', 'payable', 'U')	('would', 'payable', 'U')	
which would be payable to the fund after five years,@#%^&*
according to Stephen E. Roulac, a real estate consultant@#%^&*('Roulac', 'payable', 'U')	
working for the fund.@#%^&*('working', 'consultant', 'U')	
The purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun-off company in a form@#%^&*('is', 'said', 'U')	('capital', 'save', 'U')	
that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments,@#%^&*('save', 'capital', 'U')	
Mr. Roulac said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The spun-off concern "clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio,"@#%^&*('one', 'said', 'U')	('he', 'said', 'U')	
he said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For the last year, Santa Fe Pacific has redirected its real estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties,@#%^&*('redirected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
hurting profits@#%^&*('hurting', 'redirected', 'U')	
that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio.@#%^&*('generated', 'hurting', 'U')	
Real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to $71.9 million from $143 million a year earlier,@#%^&*('fell', 'said', 'U')	('the', 'company', 'U')	
the company said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In a statement late yesterday, Santa Fe Pacific's chairman, Robert D. Krebs, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Santa Fe Pacific Realty would repay more than $500 million in debt@#%^&*('repay', 'said', 'U')	
owed to the parent@#%^&*('owed', 'debt', 'U')	('the', 'spinoff', 'U')	
before the planned spinoff.@#%^&*('spinoff', 'owed', 'U')	
That would help reduce Santa Fe Pacific's remaining debt to about $600 million from a high of $3.7 billion in early 1988.@#%^&*('help', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It wasn't clear where Santa Fe Pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $500 million,@#%^&*('clear', 'ROOT', 'R')	('$', 'be', 'U')	
which would be well above the $400 million@#%^&*
that@#%^&*('that', 'say', 'U')	
California pension fund officials say@#%^&*('say', 'be', 'U')	
they plan to provide.@#%^&*('plan', 'say', 'U')	
The realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors, among other possibilities.@#%^&*('take', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Santa Fe Pacific spokesman declined to comment on that aspect,@#%^&*('declined', 'ROOT', 'R')	
saying@#%^&*('saying', 'declined', 'U')	
the deal was still under negotiation.@#%^&*('was', 'saying', 'U')	
Santa Fe Pacific Realty owns 2.8 million acres of property,@#%^&*('owns', 'ROOT', 'R')	
including 219 buildings with more than 11 million square feet of space.@#%^&*('buildings', 'acres', 'U')	
It also holds nearly 40,000 acres of raw land with development potential,@#%^&*('holds', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'strategy', 'U')	
but under a previously announced strategy, the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in California, Arizona and the Chicago area.@#%^&*('targeted', 'holds', 'U')	
Among those are the 1,850 acres in the San Francisco Bay area,@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	
including 208 acres in the Mission Bay area.@#%^&*
The California pension fund,@#%^&*('fund', 'has', 'U')	('fund', 'source', 'U')	
which has $16 billion@#%^&*('has', 'fund', 'U')	
already invested in real estate and mortgages,@#%^&*('invested', '$', 'U')	
could be a valuable funding source for that development,@#%^&*('source', 'ROOT', 'R')	
although it isn't obliged to make further investments.@#%^&*('obliged', 'source', 'U')	
The fund is the nation's largest public employee fund,@#%^&*('fund', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and it has a growing cash flow@#%^&*('has', 'fund', 'U')	
now topping $3 billion a year.@#%^&*('topping', 'flow', 'U')	
Fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with Santa Fe Pacific,@#%^&*('negotiated', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago.@#%^&*('approached', 'negotiated', 'U')	
JMB officials are expected to be hired@#%^&*('officials', 'represent', 'U')	('expected', 'said', 'U')	('to', 'represent', 'U')	
to represent the pension fund on the Santa Fe Pacific Realty board,@#%^&*('represent', 'hired', 'U')	
Mr. Roulac said,@#%^&*('Roulac', 'insulate', 'U')	('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to insulate the fund from potential liability problems.@#%^&*('insulate', 'said', 'U')

says Leonard Bogner, a chemical industry analyst at Prudential Bache Research.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"This could be the first of five or six down quarters."@#%^&*('first', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Perhaps most prominent, Dow Chemical Co.,@#%^&*('prominent', 'expected', 'U')	('Co.', 'racked', 'U')	('Co.', 'expected', 'U')	('Co.', 'report', 'U')	
which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters,@#%^&*('racked', 'Co.', 'U')

First Boston Corp. projects@#%^&*('projects', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that 10 of the 15 companies it follows will report lower profit.@#%^&*('report', 'projects', 'U')	
Most of the 10 have big commodity-chemical operations.@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')

largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals.@#%^&*('chemicals', 'expected', 'U')

By some accounts on Wall Street and in the industry, the inventory reductions are near an end,@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	('end', 'presage', 'U')	
which may presage firmer demand.@#%^&*('presage', 'end', 'U')	
But doubters say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')

which has an offer outstanding for the Himont shares@#%^&*('has', 'A.', 'U')

At Quantum Chemical Corp., New York, the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene, higher debt costs and the idling of an important plant due to an explosion.@#%^&*('prices', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Some analysts hedge their estimates for Quantum,@#%^&*('hedge', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because it isn't known when the company will book certain one-time charges.@#%^&*('known', 'hedge', 'U')	
But the estimates range from break-even to 35 cents a share.@#%^&*('range', 'ROOT', 'R')

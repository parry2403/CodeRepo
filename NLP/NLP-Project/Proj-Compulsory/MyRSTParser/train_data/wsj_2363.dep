it will delay a proposed two-step, 830 million Canadian-dollar@#%^&*('delay', 'said', 'U')	('million', 'expansion', 'U')	('Canadian', 'expansion', 'U')	
(US$705.6 million)@#%^&*('US$', 'expansion', 'U')	
expansion of its system@#%^&*('expansion', 'two', 'U')	
because Canada's output of crude oil is shrinking.@#%^&*('shrinking', 'delay', 'U')	
Interprovincial, Canada's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S., said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
revised industry forecasts indicate@#%^&*('indicate', 'said', 'U')	
that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991, 8% lower than a previous estimate.@#%^&*('total', 'indicate', 'U')	
Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989's first half, about 1% below the 1988 level.@#%^&*('averaged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"The capability of existing fields@#%^&*('capability', 'dropping', 'U')	
to deliver oil@#%^&*('deliver', 'capability', 'U')	
is dropping,"@#%^&*('dropping', 'said', 'U')	
and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically,@#%^&*('is', 'dropping', 'U')	('is', 'said', 'U')	
as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas,@#%^&*
said Ronald Watkins, vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial's parent, Interhome Energy Inc.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Watkins said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January@#%^&*('volume', 'expected', 'U')	('volume', 'fall', 'U')	('is', 'said', 'U')	('is', 'expected', 'U')	
and is expected to fall further,@#%^&*('expected', 'said', 'U')	
making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s.@#%^&*('making', 'expected', 'U')	
"There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side,"@#%^&*('swing', 'said', 'U')	('he', 'said', 'U')	
he said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Many of Canada's oil and gas producers say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the outlook for natural gas is better@#%^&*('better', 'say', 'U')	
than it is for oil,@#%^&*('it', 'shifted', 'U')	('is', 'better', 'U')	
and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly.@#%^&*('shifted', 'better', 'U')	('shifted', 'is', 'U')	
The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago,@#%^&*('is', 'said', 'U')	
and the number of completed oil wells is "down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration,"@#%^&*('due', 'said', 'U')	
said Robert Feick, manager of crude oil with Calgary's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Watkins said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western Canada.@#%^&*('shrinking', 'said', 'U')	
Interprovincial transports about 75% of all crude@#%^&*('transports', 'ROOT', 'R')	
produced in western Canada,@#%^&*('produced', 'crude', 'U')	
and almost 60% of Interprovincial's total volume consists of light crude.@#%^&*('consists', 'transports', 'U')	
Nearly all of the crude oil@#%^&*('all', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Canada exports to the U.S.@#%^&*('exports', 'all', 'U')	
is transported on Interprovincial's system,@#%^&*('transported', 'ROOT', 'R')	('system', 'line', 'U')	
whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region,@#%^&*('runs', 'system', 'U')	
including Chicago, Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal.@#%^&*('Chicago', 'cities', 'U')	('Buffalo', 'cities', 'U')	('Toronto', 'cities', 'U')	('Montreal', 'cities', 'U')	
Canada's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net U.S. crude imports,@#%^&*('exports', 'said', 'U')	
said John Lichtblau, president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude, behind Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico.@#%^&*('ranks', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Lichtblau said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Canada's declining crude output,@#%^&*('output', 'help', 'U')	
combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude,@#%^&*
will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas, particularly the Middle East.@#%^&*('help', 'said', 'U')	
"It's very much a growing concern.@#%^&*('much', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But when something is inevitable,@#%^&*('But', 'said', 'U')	('inevitable', 'learn', 'U')	
you learn to live with it,"@#%^&*('learn', 'said', 'U')	
he said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Lichtblau stressed@#%^&*('stressed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the delay of Interprovincial's proposed expansion won't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude, however,@#%^&*('increase', 'stressed', 'U')	
since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada's falling output.@#%^&*('limited', 'increase', 'U')	
Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion,@#%^&*('terms', 'intended', 'U')	('expansion', 'required', 'U')	
which would have required regulatory approval,@#%^&*('required', 'expansion', 'U')	
Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system,@#%^&*('intended', 'ROOT', 'R')	
beginning with a modest expansion by 1991.@#%^&*('beginning', 'add', 'U')	
The system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day.@#%^&*('has', 'ROOT', 'R')

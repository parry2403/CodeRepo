Predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately.@#%^&*('job', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Take Microsoft Corp., the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether.@#%^&*('Take', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In July, the company stunned Wall Street with the prediction@#%^&*('stunned', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only 10% in 1990, a modest increase@#%^&*('%', 'stunned', 'U')	
when compared with the sizzling expansion of years past.@#%^&*('compared', '%', 'U')	
Investors@#%^&*('Investors', 'reacted', 'U')	
-- taking this as a sign@#%^&*('taking', 'Investors', 'U')	
that a broad industry slump was in the offing --@#%^&*('was', 'taking', 'U')	
reacted@#%^&*('reacted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
by selling the company's stock,@#%^&*('selling', 'reacted', 'U')	('stock', 'lost', 'U')	
which lost $3.25 that day@#%^&*('lost', 'stock', 'U')	
to close at $52 in national over-the-counter trading.@#%^&*('close', 'lost', 'U')	
But that was all of three months ago.@#%^&*('all', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Last week, Microsoft said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it expects revenue for its first quarter@#%^&*('expects', 'said', 'U')	
ended Sept. 30@#%^&*('ended', 'quarter', 'U')	
to increase 34%.@#%^&*('increase', 'ended', 'U')	
The announcement caused the company's stock to surge $6.50@#%^&*('caused', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'close', 'U')	
to close at $75.50 a share.@#%^&*('close', 'surge', 'U')	
Microsoft's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty@#%^&*('example', 'ROOT', 'R')	
facing investors@#%^&*('facing', 'difficulty', 'U')	
looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms.@#%^&*('looking', 'investors', 'U')	
"It's hard to know what to expect at this point,"@#%^&*('hard', 'said', 'U')	
said Peter Rogers, an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"The industry defies characterization."@#%^&*('defies', 'ROOT', 'R')	
To illustrate,@#%^&*('illustrate', 'said', 'U')	
Mr. Rogers said@#%^&*('said', 'report', 'U')	
that of the 14 computer-related firms@#%^&*('that', 'follows', 'U')	('firms', 'follows', 'U')	('he', 'follows', 'U')	
he follows,@#%^&*('follows', 'said', 'U')	
half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year's results, and half above those results.@#%^&*('report', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Among those companies@#%^&*('companies', 'are', 'U')	
expected to have a down quarter@#%^&*('expected', 'companies', 'U')	
are Hewlett-Packard Co., Amdahl Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc., generally solid performers in the past.@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	
International Business Machines Corp. also is expected to report disappointing results.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Apple Computer Inc., meanwhile, is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended Sept.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Another contradictory message comes from Businessland Inc., a computer retailer.@#%^&*('comes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In July, the company reported@#%^&*('reported', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income@#%^&*('resulted', 'reported', 'U')	
more than doubling for its fourth quarter@#%^&*('doubling', 'income', 'U')	
ended June 30 to $7.4 million, or 23 cents a share.@#%^&*('ended', 'quarter', 'U')	
This month, however, Businessland warned investors@#%^&*('warned', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that results for its first quarter@#%^&*('that', 'met', 'U')	('results', 'met', 'U')	
ended Sept. 30@#%^&*('ended', 'quarter', 'U')	
hadn't met expectations.@#%^&*('met', 'warned', 'U')	
The company said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it expects earnings of 14 to 17 cents a share, down from 25 cents a share in the year-earlier period.@#%^&*('expects', 'said', 'U')	
While the earnings picture confuses,@#%^&*('confuses', 'say', 'U')	
observers say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the major forces@#%^&*('forces', 'clearer', 'U')	
expected to shape the industry in the coming year@#%^&*('expected', 'forces', 'U')	
are clearer.@#%^&*('clearer', 'say', 'U')	
Companies will continue to war over standards.@#%^&*('continue', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In computer publishing, a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Inc.,@#%^&*('hurting', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Inc.', 'sells', 'U')	
which sells software@#%^&*('sells', 'Inc.', 'U')	('software', 'controls', 'U')	
that controls the image@#%^&*('controls', 'software', 'U')	
produced by printers and displays.@#%^&*('produced', 'image', 'U')	
Until recently, Adobe had a lock on the market for image software,@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but last month Apple, Adobe's biggest customer, and Microsoft rebelled.@#%^&*('rebelled', 'had', 'U')	
Now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to Adobe's approach,@#%^&*('collaborating', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and analysts say@#%^&*('say', 'collaborating', 'U')	
they are likely to carry IBM, the biggest seller of personal computers, along with them.@#%^&*('likely', 'say', 'U')	
The short-term outlook for Adobe's business, however, appears strong.@#%^&*('appears', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The company is beginning to ship a new software program@#%^&*('beginning', 'ROOT', 'R')	('program', 'heralded', 'U')	
that's being heralded as a boon for owners of low-end printers@#%^&*('heralded', 'program', 'U')	
sold by Apple.@#%^&*('sold', 'printers', 'U')	
The program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material.@#%^&*('aimed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
John Warnock, Adobe's chief executive officer, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the Mountain View, Calif., company has been receiving 1,000 calls a day about the product@#%^&*('receiving', 'said', 'U')	
since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago.@#%^&*('demonstrated', 'day', 'U')	
Meanwhile, competition between various operating systems,@#%^&*('Meanwhile', 'spells', 'U')	('competition', 'control', 'U')	('competition', 'spells', 'U')	
which control the basic functions of a computer,@#%^&*('control', 'competition', 'U')	
spells trouble for software firms generally.@#%^&*('spells', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"It creates uncertainty@#%^&*('It', 'slows', 'U')	('creates', 'said', 'U')	
and usually slows down sales,"@#%^&*('slows', 'creates', 'U')	('slows', 'said', 'U')	
said Russ Crabs, an analyst at Soundview Financial Group.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Crabs said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
this probably is behind the expected weak performance of Aldus Corp., maker of a widely used computer publishing program.@#%^&*('is', 'said', 'U')	
He expects Aldus to report earnings of 21 cents a share on revenues of $19.5 million for its third quarter,@#%^&*('expects', 'ROOT', 'R')	
compared with earnings of 30 cents a share on revenue of 20.4 million in the year-earlier period.@#%^&*('with', 'report', 'U')	('earnings', 'report', 'U')	
Aldus officials couldn't be reached for comment.@#%^&*('reached', 'ROOT', 'R')	
On the other hand, the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A bus is the data highway within a computer.@#%^&*('highway', 'ROOT', 'R')	
IBM is backing one type of bus@#%^&*('backing', 'ROOT', 'R')	
called microchannel,@#%^&*('called', 'bus', 'U')	
while the nine other leading computer makers,@#%^&*('while', 'chosen', 'U')	('makers', 'chosen', 'U')	
including H-P and Compaq Computer Corp.,@#%^&*('H', 'makers', 'U')	('Corp.', 'makers', 'U')	
have chosen another method.@#%^&*('chosen', 'called', 'U')	
"Users don't care about the bus,"@#%^&*('care', 'said', 'U')	
said Daniel Benton, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
He said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Apple's family of Macintosh computers, for instance, uses four different buses@#%^&*('family', 'said', 'U')	('instance', 'said', 'U')	('uses', 'said', 'U')	
"and no one seems to mind."@#%^&*('seems', 'said', 'U')	
The gap between winners and laggards will grow.@#%^&*('grow', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In personal computers, Apple, Compaq and IBM are expected to tighten their hold on their business.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At the same time, second-tier firms will continue to lose ground.@#%^&*('continue', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether.@#%^&*('leave', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Wyse Technology, for instance, is considered a candidate@#%^&*('considered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to sell its troubled operation.@#%^&*('sell', 'candidate', 'U')	
"Wyse has done well@#%^&*('done', 'said', 'U')	
establishing a distribution business,@#%^&*('establishing', 'done', 'U')	
but they haven't delivered products@#%^&*('delivered', 'done', 'U')	('delivered', 'said', 'U')	('products', 'sell', 'U')	
that sell,"@#%^&*('sell', 'products', 'U')	
said Kimball Brown, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Brown estimates@#%^&*('estimates', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Wyse,@#%^&*('Wyse', 'business', 'U')	('Wyse', 'report', 'U')	
whose terminals business is strong,@#%^&*('strong', 'Wyse', 'U')	
will report a loss of 12 cents a share for its quarter@#%^&*('report', 'estimates', 'U')	
ended Sept.@#%^&*('ended', 'quarter', 'U')	
Personal-computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms.@#%^&*('continue', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Ever-more powerful desk-top computers,@#%^&*('computers', 'expected', 'U')	('computers', 'take', 'U')	
designed with one or more microprocessors as their "brains,"@#%^&*('designed', 'computers', 'U')	
are expected to increasingly take on functions@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes.@#%^&*('carried', 'functions', 'U')	
"The guys@#%^&*('guys', 'make', 'U')	('guys', 'obsoleted', 'U')	
that make traditional hardware@#%^&*('make', 'guys', 'U')	('are', 'obsoleted', 'U')	
are really being obsoleted by microprocessor-based machines,"@#%^&*('obsoleted', 'said', 'U')	
said Mr. Benton.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
As a result of this trend,@#%^&*('result', 'scrambling', 'U')	
longtime powerhouses H-P, IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor-based systems of their own.@#%^&*('scrambling', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But they will have to act quickly.@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Benton expects Compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year@#%^&*('expects', 'ROOT', 'R')	('computers', 'powerful', 'U')	('computers', 'serve', 'U')	
that are powerful enough@#%^&*('powerful', 'computers', 'U')	
to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk-top machines.@#%^&*('serve', 'powerful', 'U')	
A raft of new computer companies also has targeted this "server" market.@#%^&*('targeted', 'ROOT', 'R')

Japan has climbed up from the ashes of World War II and a gross national product of about $800 per capita@#%^&*('Japan', 'reach', 'U')	('climbed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations.@#%^&*('reach', 'climbed', 'U')	
Now this remarkable economic growth seems to be coming to an end@#%^&*('seems', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because the government has not converted itself into a modern, democratic, "developed nation" mode of operation.@#%^&*('converted', 'coming', 'U')	
Until 1980,@#%^&*('1980', 'model', 'U')	
when Japan joined the $10,000 per capita GNP club of the advanced countries,@#%^&*('joined', 'model', 'U')	('it', 'model', 'U')	
it was a model developing nation.@#%^&*('model', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The government built ports, bridges, highways, schools, hospitals and railways.@#%^&*('built', 'ROOT', 'R')	
When industries were weak,@#%^&*('weak', 'protected', 'U')	
it protected them.@#%^&*('protected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It gave the Japanese people a value system,@#%^&*('gave', 'ROOT', 'R')	
based on the rationalization@#%^&*('based', 'system', 'U')	
that@#%^&*('that', 'work', 'U')	
given the country's lack of natural resources,@#%^&*('given', 'work', 'U')	
they must work hard@#%^&*('work', 'based', 'U')	
to create value through exports@#%^&*('create', 'hard', 'U')	
and buy food with the surplus.@#%^&*('buy', 'hard', 'U')	('buy', 'create', 'U')	
Individual prosperity inevitably would result.@#%^&*('result', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That system has worked.@#%^&*('worked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The standard of living has increased steadily over the past 40 years;@#%^&*('increased', 'ROOT', 'R')	
more than 90% of the people consider themselves middle class.@#%^&*('consider', 'increased', 'U')	
The people have given their leading and only credible political party, the Liberal Democratic Party, clear and uninterrupted power for those 40 years.@#%^&*('given', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The LDP won by a landslide in the last election, in July 1986.@#%^&*('won', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But less than two years later, the LDP started to crumble,@#%^&*('started', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and dissent rose to unprecedented heights.@#%^&*('rose', 'started', 'U')	
The symptoms all point to one thing:@#%^&*('point', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Japan does not have a modern government.@#%^&*('have', 'point', 'U')	
Its government still wants to sit in the driver's seat, set the speed, step on the gas, apply the brakes and steer, with 120 million people in the back seat.@#%^&*('wants', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In a modern system, the government's role is to give the people as much choice as possible@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'keep', 'U')	
and to keep them well informed@#%^&*('keep', 'is', 'U')	('keep', 'give', 'U')	
so they are capable of making a choice.@#%^&*('capable', 'keep', 'U')	
It also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world.@#%^&*('allows', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Japanese government doesn't allow this.@#%^&*('allow', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions.@#%^&*('ministry', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Ministry of Health and Welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization@#%^&*('ministry', 'ROOT', 'R')	
dedicated to protecting the health of the people.@#%^&*('dedicated', 'organization', 'U')	
The Ministry of Education is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers,@#%^&*('Ministry', 'act', 'U')	('nothing', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and certainly does not act on behalf of students.@#%^&*('act', 'nothing', 'U')	
The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country@#%^&*('Ministry', 'boasts', 'U')	('spreads', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and boasts in international conferences@#%^&*('boasts', 'spreads', 'U')	
that Japan's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world,@#%^&*('longest', 'boasts', 'U')	
but they seldom think of the poor commuters@#%^&*('think', 'spreads', 'U')	('commuters', 'spend', 'U')	
who spend so much time@#%^&*('spend', 'commuters', 'U')	('time', 'sitting', 'U')	
sitting in traffic.@#%^&*('sitting', 'spend', 'U')	
The Ministry of Transportation serves the industry, certainly not the passengers@#%^&*('serves', 'ROOT', 'R')	('passengers', 'pay', 'U')	
who must pay extraordinarily high prices.@#%^&*('pay', 'passengers', 'U')	
And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs works for itself,@#%^&*('works', 'ROOT', 'R')	
supporting Japanese diplomats@#%^&*('supporting', 'works', 'U')	('diplomats', 'sprinkle', 'U')	
who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world@#%^&*('sprinkle', 'diplomats', 'U')	
to ensure@#%^&*('ensure', 'world', 'U')	
that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host's.@#%^&*('next', 'ensure', 'U')	
This ministry has done nothing@#%^&*('done', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions@#%^&*('correct', 'done', 'U')	('misunderstandings', 'are', 'U')	('misperceptions', 'are', 'U')	
that are at the root of Japan's deteriorating image.@#%^&*('are', 'misunderstandings', 'U')	
Instead, it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict@#%^&*('seems', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'expand', 'U')	
to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries.@#%^&*('expand', 'using', 'U')	
All this illustrates that Japanese ministries still have a "provider" mentality;@#%^&*('illustrates', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they do not serve the people, and particularly not consumers.@#%^&*('serve', 'illustrates', 'U')	
They serve the industries and the special-interest groups.@#%^&*('serve', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The rest of the world accepted such methods@#%^&*('accepted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when Japan was developing.@#%^&*('developing', 'accepted', 'U')	
Japanese put up with it@#%^&*('put', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because the government provided job stability and growing paychecks.@#%^&*('provided', 'put', 'U')	
Japan is not a political country.@#%^&*('country', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It is a bureaucratic country.@#%^&*('country', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Diet plays a minor role@#%^&*('plays', 'ROOT', 'R')	
compared with the powerful bureaucratic system.@#%^&*('with', 'plays', 'U')	('system', 'plays', 'U')	
Most bills are drafted by bureaucrats, not politicians.@#%^&*('drafted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Diet doesn't normally even debate bills@#%^&*('debate', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever LDP does@#%^&*('opposed', 'debate', 'U')	
that it would be a waste of time.@#%^&*('waste', 'does', 'U')	
So most bills are passed@#%^&*('passed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
without full discussion;@#%^&*('discussion', 'passed', 'U')	
particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties.@#%^&*
A recent example is the 3% consumption tax on all commercial activities.@#%^&*('tax', 'ROOT', 'R')	
This makes enormous sense in Japan,@#%^&*('makes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
where direct tax accounts for more than 70% of revenues@#%^&*('where', 'unfair', 'U')	('accounts', 'unfair', 'U')	
and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair.@#%^&*('rate', 'accounts', 'U')	('rate', '%', 'U')	('unfair', 'makes', 'U')	
If you are a salaried man,@#%^&*('man', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Amen!@#%^&*('Amen', 'man', 'U')	
100% captured.@#%^&*('captured', 'man', 'U')	
If you are a retailer,@#%^&*('retailer', '%', 'U')	
50%, and a farmer, 30%.@#%^&*('%', 'ROOT', 'R')	
To correct this inequality,@#%^&*('correct', 'favored', 'U')	
most people would have favored an indirect tax, like the consumption tax.@#%^&*('favored', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the bill was passed@#%^&*('passed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
without debate in the Diet, in the absence of the opposition.@#%^&*('debate', 'passed', 'U')	('Diet', 'passed', 'U')	('absence', 'passed', 'U')	
As a result, the Japanese people didn't know what to expect@#%^&*('know', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when the new law was introduced on April 1.@#%^&*('introduced', 'expect', 'U')	
They were frustrated by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins@#%^&*('frustrated', 'ROOT', 'R')	
given as change.@#%^&*('given', 'frustrated', 'U')	
All of a sudden, prices were no longer in denominations of 100 or 200.@#%^&*('were', 'ROOT', 'R')	
They were 103 or 206.@#%^&*('103', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Pockets exploded with one-yen coins.@#%^&*('exploded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
While people were jingling their change,@#%^&*('jingling', 'caught', 'U')	('the', 'politicians', 'U')	
the LDP politicians were caught in scandals.@#%^&*('caught', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Money, such as in Recruit's political donations, and women, as in the cases of Prime Minister Sosuke Uno and Secretary General Tokuo Yamashita, seldom have caused political scandals in Japan.@#%^&*('caused', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Whereas most men were a bit ambivalent about the sex scandals@#%^&*('ambivalent', 'upset', 'U')	
(though they were furious about Recruit),@#%^&*('furious', 'ambivalent', 'U')	
women were upset about both@#%^&*('women', 'surged', 'U')	('upset', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and surged to the polls.@#%^&*('surged', 'upset', 'U')	
In the recent Upper House and Tokyo metropolitan congressional elections,@#%^&*('House', 'won', 'U')	('House', 'voted', 'U')	('elections', 'won', 'U')	('elections', 'voted', 'U')	('the', 'Party', 'U')	
in which the Socialist Party won a runaway victory,@#%^&*('won', 'House', 'U')	
60% of all women voted,@#%^&*('voted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as opposed to the usual 40%.@#%^&*('opposed', 'voted', 'U')	
It is difficult to analyze how much of their anger was due to Recruit, the sex scandals, or the one-yen coins in their purses,@#%^&*('difficult', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but they obviously were voting@#%^&*('they', 'punish', 'U')	('voting', 'difficult', 'U')	
to punish the LDP.@#%^&*('punish', 'voting', 'U')	
Taken by surprise,@#%^&*('Taken', 'busy', 'U')	
the Socialist Party is busy changing its doctrines.@#%^&*('busy', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It's now OK to deal with the U.S., but not the Soviet Union.@#%^&*('OK', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Nuclear power plants are acceptable.@#%^&*('acceptable', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty can continue, sort of.@#%^&*('continue', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And so on.@#%^&*('on', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the Socialist Party@#%^&*('overhaul', 'paralyzed', 'U')	('the', 'LDP', 'U')	
the LDP has been paralyzed.@#%^&*('paralyzed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Now is the time@#%^&*('time', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to reform the government from a provider, developing-country vanguard role to that of a modern, industrialized nation@#%^&*('reform', 'time', 'U')	('nation', 'have', 'U')	
in which consumers have the ultimate choice.@#%^&*('have', 'nation', 'U')	
If the LDP,@#%^&*('If', 'make', 'U')	('LDP', 'make', 'U')	
as currently composed,@#%^&*('composed', 'LDP', 'U')	
can't make the transformation,@#%^&*('make', 'split', 'U')	
then it should split into two parties.@#%^&*('split', 'ROOT', 'R')	
One party could stand for consumer interests, small government, free trade and globalism@#%^&*('party', 'put', 'U')	('stand', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to put Japan clearly among the most developed and open countries.@#%^&*('put', 'stand', 'U')	
The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP,@#%^&*('continue', 'ROOT', 'R')	
representing the manufacturers' preference for larger government, control, regulation and protectionism.@#%^&*('representing', 'continue', 'U')	
The LDP must make a decision immediately;@#%^&*('make', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Lower House elections must take place before June.@#%^&*('take', 'make', 'U')	
In the current mood of the Japanese people, journalists and even some industrialists, giving power to the Socialists might be good for the LDP,@#%^&*('good', 'ROOT', 'R')	
cleansing it of past sins.@#%^&*('cleansing', 'good', 'U')	
We must not forget, however,@#%^&*('forget', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets.@#%^&*('cause', 'forget', 'U')	
At the most there is only nine months@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	('months', 'burns', 'U')	
before the LDP fuse burns out.@#%^&*('burns', 'is', 'U')	('burns', 'is', 'U')	
Mr. Ohmae is managing director of McKinsey & Co. in Japan.@#%^&*('director', 'ROOT', 'R')

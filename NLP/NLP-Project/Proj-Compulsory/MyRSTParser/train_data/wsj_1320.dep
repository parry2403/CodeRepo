with some accounts putting the 13-nation group's output as high as 23 million barrels a day.@#%^&*('putting', 'producing', 'U')	
That level of production didn't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter,@#%^&*('take', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when demand is traditionally strong.@#%^&*('strong', 'quarter', 'U')	
But@#%^&*('But', 'have', 'U')	
because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year,@#%^&*('weakest', 'have', 'U')	
several market participants say,@#%^&*('say', 'have', 'U')	
OPEC production will have to decline@#%^&*('production', 'keep', 'U')	('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'keep', 'U')	
to keep prices from eroding further.@#%^&*('keep', 'decline', 'U')	
The group plans to meet in a month@#%^&*('plans', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'discuss', 'U')	
to discuss production strategy for early 1990.@#%^&*('discuss', 'month', 'U')	
With prices already headed lower,@#%^&*('prices', 'bearish', 'U')	
news of a series of explosions at a major Phillips Petroleum Co. chemical facility on the Houston Ship Channel also was bearish for prices.@#%^&*('bearish', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude,@#%^&*('use', 'say', 'U')	
analysts say,@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
now the facility won't need any, at a time of already high availability.@#%^&*('need', 'say', 'U')	
The Phillips plant makes polyethylene, polypropylene and other plastic products.@#%^&*('makes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A company official said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the explosions began@#%^&*('began', 'said', 'U')	
when a seal blew out.@#%^&*('blew', 'began', 'U')	
Dozens of workers were injured,@#%^&*('injured', 'said', 'U')	
authorities said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
There was no immediate estimate of damage from the company.@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Some petroleum futures traders say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices.@#%^&*('help', 'say', 'U')	
For instance, one trader said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that prices inevitably will go lower@#%^&*('go', 'said', 'U')	('lower', 'now', 'U')	
now that they've fallen below $20 a barrel.@#%^&*('now', 'go', 'U')	
"Our technician is a little bearish@#%^&*('bearish', 'said', 'U')	
now that we've taken out $20,"@#%^&*('now', 'bearish', 'U')	('taken', 'bearish', 'U')	
he said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')

continued yesterday.@#%^&*('yesterday', 'started', 'U')	
The December contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $1.1960.@#%^&*('fell', 'ROOT', 'R')	
London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons;@#%^&*('were', 'ROOT', 'R')	
expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons.@#%^&*
The New York market made its high for the day on the opening@#%^&*('made', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and@#%^&*('when', 'dropped', 'U')	
when it dropped below the $1.23-a-pound level,@#%^&*('dropped', 'picked', 'U')	
selling picked up@#%^&*('picked', 'made', 'U')	
as previous buyers bailed out of their positions@#%^&*('bailed', 'picked', 'U')	
and aggressive short sellers@#%^&*('sellers', 'bailed', 'U')	('sellers', 'positions', 'U')	
-- anticipating further declines --@#%^&*('anticipating', 'positions', 'U')	
moved in.@#%^&*('moved', 'positions', 'U')	
Fund selling also picked up at that point.@#%^&*('picked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
According to Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber,@#%^&*('to', 'came', 'U')	('Savaiko', 'came', 'U')	
the only stability to the market came@#%^&*('came', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when short sellers periodically moved in@#%^&*('sellers', 'cover', 'U')	('moved', 'came', 'U')	
to cover their positions@#%^&*('cover', 'moved', 'U')	
by buying contracts.@#%^&*('buying', 'cover', 'U')	
This activity produced small rallies,@#%^&*('produced', 'ROOT', 'R')	('rallies', 'attracted', 'U')	
which in turn attracted new short selling.@#%^&*('attracted', 'rallies', 'U')	
Mr. Savaiko noted@#%^&*('noted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that copper had a steep fall@#%^&*('had', 'noted', 'U')	('a', 'dollar', 'U')	
in spite of a weak dollar,@#%^&*('dollar', 'fall', 'U')	('dollar', 'support', 'U')	
which would normally support the U.S. copper market.@#%^&*('support', 'dollar', 'U')	
Such support usually comes from arbitragers@#%^&*('comes', 'ROOT', 'R')	('arbitragers', 'use', 'U')	
who use a strong British pound@#%^&*('use', 'arbitragers', 'U')	
to buy copper in New York.@#%^&*('buy', 'use', 'U')	
"The sell-off would probably have been worse@#%^&*('worse', 'said', 'U')	
if the dollar had been strong,"@#%^&*('strong', 'worse', 'U')	('he', 'said', 'U')	
he said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Copper has been stuck in a trading range of $1.19 to $1.34.@#%^&*('stuck', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Savaiko believes@#%^&*('believes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that@#%^&*('that', '$', 'U')	
if copper falls below the bottom of this range@#%^&*('falls', '$', 'U')	('the', 'level', 'U')	
the next significant support level will be about $1.04.@#%^&*('$', 'believes', 'U')	
PRECIOUS METALS:@#%^&*('METALS', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Platinum and palladium struggled to maintain their prices all day@#%^&*('Platinum', 'METALS', 'U')	('palladium', 'METALS', 'U')	
despite news stories over the weekend@#%^&*('stories', 'maintain', 'U')	
that recent cold fusion experiments,@#%^&*('that', 'showed', 'U')	('experiments', 'use', 'U')	('experiments', 'showed', 'U')	
which use both metals,@#%^&*('use', 'experiments', 'U')	
showed signs@#%^&*('showed', 'struggled', 'U')	
of producing extra heat.@#%^&*('producing', 'signs', 'U')	
January platinum closed down $2.80 an ounce at $486.30, nearly $4 above its low for the day.@#%^&*('closed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
December palladium was off $1.55 an ounce at $137.20.@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Platinum is believed to have good support around $480 and palladium at around $130.@#%^&*('believed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Some traders were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report,@#%^&*('thought', 'ROOT', 'R')	('report', 'released', 'U')	
which will be released today.@#%^&*('released', 'report', 'U')	
Such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders@#%^&*('watched', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters.@#%^&*('used', 'watched', 'U')	
Mr. Savaiko theorized@#%^&*('theorized', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the news on cold fusion didn't affect the market yesterday@#%^&*('affect', 'theorized', 'U')	
because many traders have already been badly burnt by such stories.@#%^&*('burnt', 'affect', 'U')	
He said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the traders are demanding a higher level of proof@#%^&*('demanding', 'said', 'U')	
before they will buy palladium again.@#%^&*('buy', 'demanding', 'U')	
Also weighing on both metals' prices is the role of the chief supplier, the Soviet Union.@#%^&*('weighing', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Many analysts believe@#%^&*('believe', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the Soviets' thirst for dollars this year@#%^&*('that', 'bring', 'U')	('thirst', 'bring', 'U')	
to buy grain and other Western commodities and goods@#%^&*('buy', 'thirst', 'U')	
will bring them to the market@#%^&*('bring', 'believe', 'U')	
whenever prices rally very much.@#%^&*('rally', 'bring', 'U')	
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS:@#%^&*('GRAINS', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Prices closed mixed@#%^&*('closed', 'GRAINS', 'U')	
as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news.@#%^&*('reacted', 'closed', 'U')	
On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for November delivery closed at $5.63 a bushel, down half a cent,@#%^&*('closed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
while the December wheat contract rose three-quarters of a cent to $4.0775 a bushel.@#%^&*('rose', 'closed', 'U')	
Supporting prices was the announcement late Friday of additional grain sales to the Soviet Union.@#%^&*('announcement', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the Farm Belt.@#%^&*('weather', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Strong farmer selling over the weekend also weighed on prices.@#%^&*('weighed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
SUGAR:@#%^&*('SUGAR', 'ROOT', 'R')	
World prices tumbled, mostly from their own weight,@#%^&*('tumbled', 'SUGAR', 'U')

and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan.@#%^&*('expectations', 'expecting', 'U')	
But with no reports@#%^&*('But', 'said', 'U')	('reports', 'entering', 'U')	
of either country actually entering the market,@#%^&*('country', 'reports', 'U')	('entering', 'said', 'U')	
analysts said,@#%^&*('said', 'became', 'U')	
futures prices became vulnerable.@#%^&*('became', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Developing countries such as India,@#%^&*('countries', 'seem', 'U')	('countries', 'made', 'U')	
some analysts said,@#%^&*('said', 'seem', 'U')	
seem to have made it a point@#%^&*('seem', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'stay', 'U')	
to stay away@#%^&*('stay', 'point', 'U')	
whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range, around 14.75 cents,@#%^&*('reached', 'stay', 'U')	
and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range, around 13.50 cents.@#%^&*('wait', 'point', 'U')	('wait', 'stay', 'U')	
But Erik Dunlaevy, a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd., said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler:@#%^&*('simpler', 'said', 'U')	
Speculators,@#%^&*('Speculators', 'got', 'U')	('Speculators', 'ran', 'U')	
he said,@#%^&*('said', 'got', 'U')	
"got too long too soon@#%^&*('got', 'simpler', 'U')	
and ran into resistance around the old contract highs."@#%^&*('ran', 'simpler', 'U')	('ran', 'got', 'U')	
A PaineWebber analyst said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption, sugar isn't likely to rise above the top of its trading range@#%^&*('likely', 'said', 'U')	('a', 'problem', 'U')	
without a crop problem in a major producing country.@#%^&*('problem', 'rise', 'U')	
COCOA:@#%^&*('COCOA', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Futures rallied modestly.@#%^&*('rallied', 'COCOA', 'U')

Gill & Duffus Ltd., a British cocoa-trading house, estimated@#%^&*('estimated', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the 1989-90 world cocoa surplus would be 231,000 tons, down from 314,000 tons for the previous year.@#%^&*('tons', 'estimated', 'U')	
Market technicians were encouraged by the price patterns,@#%^&*('encouraged', 'ROOT', 'R')	('patterns', 'preceded', 'U')	('the', 'past', 'U')	
which in the past have preceded sharp rallies.@#%^&*('preceded', 'patterns', 'U')	
Recent prices for cocoa have been near levels@#%^&*('prices', 'seen', 'U')	('have', 'seen', 'U')	('been', 'seen', 'U')	('levels', 'last', 'U')	
last seen in the mid-1970s.@#%^&*('seen', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At such prices,@#%^&*('prices', 'uncommon', 'U')	
according to Mr. Savaiko,@#%^&*('to', 'uncommon', 'U')	('Savaiko', 'uncommon', 'U')	
bargain hunting and short-covering@#%^&*('hunting', 'uncommon', 'U')	('short', 'uncommon', 'U')

by speculators isn't uncommon.@#%^&*('speculators', 'hunting', 'U')	('uncommon', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But Mr. Savaiko expects stepped-up producer selling at around the $1,040 to $1,050 level.@#%^&*('expects', 'ROOT', 'R')	
He also noted@#%^&*('noted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in New York@#%^&*('helped', 'noted', 'U')	
as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move.@#%^&*('took', 'helped', 'U')	
Sandra Kaul, research analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the Ivory Coast, a major cocoa producer.@#%^&*('pushed', 'said', 'U')

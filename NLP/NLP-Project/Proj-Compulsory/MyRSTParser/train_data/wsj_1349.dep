and to extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo.@#%^&*('extend', 'funding', 'U')	('extend', 'assist', 'U')	
The package was termed excessive by the Bush administration,@#%^&*('termed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but it also provoked a struggle with influential California lawmakers@#%^&*('provoked', 'termed', 'U')	('struggle', 'sought', 'U')	('struggle', 'add', 'U')	('struggle', 'waive', 'U')	
who sought unsuccessfully to add nearly $1 billion more and waive current restrictions@#%^&*('sought', 'struggle', 'U')	('to', 'expedite', 'U')	
to expedite the distribution of funds.@#%^&*('expedite', 'waive', 'U')	
By a 26-7 margin, the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative,@#%^&*('scuttled', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'debate', 'U')	
and the debate forced a strained confrontation between Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten@#%^&*('forced', 'scuttled', 'U')	
(D., Miss.)@#%^&*('D.', 'Whitten', 'U')	
and his party's largest state delegation in the House.@#%^&*('delegation', 'forced', 'U')	('delegation', 'Whitten', 'U')	('House', 'forced', 'U')

(D.,Calif.),@#%^&*('D.', 'Fazio', 'U')	
who sought later to play down the sometimes hostile tone of the long evening meeting.@#%^&*('sought', 'Fazio', 'U')	
"We are the Golden State,"@#%^&*('State', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Fazio said,@#%^&*('said', 'State', 'U')	
"and there is a certain amount of jealousy."@#%^&*('is', 'State', 'U')	
The $2.85 billion package incorporates $500 million for small-business loans, $1 billion in highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion@#%^&*('incorporates', 'ROOT', 'R')	
divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve@#%^&*('divided', '$', 'U')	
to be available to President Bush@#%^&*('available', 'divided', 'U')	('to', 'meet', 'U')	
to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters.@#%^&*('meet', 'available', 'U')	
The funding is attached to a stopgap bill@#%^&*('funding', 'keep', 'U')	('attached', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'keep', 'U')	
to keep most of the government operating through Nov. 15.@#%^&*('keep', 'attached', 'U')	
The measure is expected to come before the House today,@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and Congress is under pressure@#%^&*('is', 'expected', 'U')	
to complete action before midnight EDT tomorrow,@#%^&*('complete', 'pressure', 'U')	
when the current continuing resolution expires.@#%^&*('expires', 'is', 'U')	
Given California's size and political importance,@#%^&*('Given', 'eager', 'U')	
the White House is eager to appear generous.@#%^&*('eager', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But in private meetings yesterday, Budget Director Richard Darman argued@#%^&*('argued', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that only $1.5 billion in new federal appropriations are needed@#%^&*('$', 'supplement', 'U')	('needed', 'argued', 'U')	
to supplement existing resources.@#%^&*('supplement', 'needed', 'U')	
A White House budget office analysis estimates@#%^&*('estimates', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that $500 million@#%^&*('that', 'needed', 'U')	('$', 'needed', 'U')	('$', 'meet', 'U')	
-- or half the level in the committee bill --@#%^&*('level', '$', 'U')	('level', 'needed', 'U')	('level', 'meet', 'U')	
is needed for highway assistance@#%^&*('needed', 'estimates', 'U')	
to meet California's needs,@#%^&*('meet', 'needed', 'U')	
and the administration rejects the notion@#%^&*('rejects', 'estimates', 'U')	
that new appropriations are needed@#%^&*('appropriations', 'finance', 'U')	('needed', 'rejects', 'U')	
to finance disaster loans by the Small Business Administration.@#%^&*('finance', 'needed', 'U')	
"Everybody appreciates@#%^&*('appreciates', 'said', 'U')	
that it is a national disaster@#%^&*('disaster', 'appreciates', 'U')	('that', 'got', 'U')	
and that we've got to address it,"@#%^&*('got', 'appreciates', 'U')	('got', 'disaster', 'U')	
said Mr. Darman,@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Darman', 'came', 'U')	('Darman', 'meet', 'U')	
who came to the Capitol@#%^&*('came', 'Darman', 'U')	('to', 'meet', 'U')	
to meet with Mr. Whitten and California lawmakers before the committee session.@#%^&*('meet', 'came', 'U')	
"I would hope very much@#%^&*('hope', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that we wouldn't end up in a kind of situation@#%^&*('end', 'much', 'U')	('end', 'much', 'U')	
where you have a bidding war and then a veto threat."@#%^&*('have', 'end', 'U')	
Although this White House pressure was clearly a factor among committee Republicans,@#%^&*('factor', 'greater', 'U')	
no single influence was greater than Mr. Whitten.@#%^&*('greater', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A master of pork-barrel politics, he had crafted the $2.85 billion package in vintage style@#%^&*('he', 'used', 'U')	('crafted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and used the full force of his chairmanship@#%^&*('used', 'crafted', 'U')	
to keep the proposal intact@#%^&*('keep', 'chairmanship', 'U')	
and dismiss any alternative.@#%^&*('dismiss', 'chairmanship', 'U')	('dismiss', 'keep', 'U')	
When Mr. Fazio offered the California-backed $3.84 billion plan,@#%^&*('offered', 'insisted', 'U')	('Mr.', 'Whitten', 'U')	
Mr. Whitten insisted@#%^&*('insisted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the full 14 pages be read aloud by the panel's clerk@#%^&*('read', 'insisted', 'U')	
to underscore the range of legislative changes@#%^&*('underscore', 'clerk', 'U')	
also sought by the delegation.@#%^&*('sought', 'changes', 'U')	
On the chairman's motion, the California package was subsequently reduced to less-binding report language,@#%^&*('reduced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and@#%^&*('even', 'accepted', 'U')	
even when this was accepted as such on a voice vote,@#%^&*('accepted', 'opposed', 'U')	
Mr. Whitten pointedly opposed it.@#%^&*('opposed', 'reduced', 'U')	
More important than money in many cases are waivers@#%^&*('important', 'California', 'U')	
California is seeking on current restrictions@#%^&*('seeking', 'ROOT', 'R')	
covering federal highway funds, such as a $100 million cap@#%^&*('covering', 'seeking', 'U')	('on', 'receive', 'U')	
on how much any single state can receive in emergency funds in a year.@#%^&*('receive', 'cap', 'U')	
Mr. Whitten's package appears to accomplish this purpose,@#%^&*('appears', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but the state faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver@#%^&*('faces', 'appears', 'U')	
on having to put up any matching funds on repairs@#%^&*('having', 'waiver', 'U')	
completed in the next six months.@#%^&*('completed', 'repairs', 'U')

The California Democrat appeared embarrassed by provisions@#%^&*('appeared', 'ROOT', 'R')	
inserted on behalf of owners of private beaches in the Virgin Islands,@#%^&*('inserted', 'provisions', 'U')

California's high-priced real estate puts it in an awkward position, too.@#%^&*('puts', 'ROOT', 'R')	
One provision last night would have raised the cap on disaster loans to $500,000 from $100,000 per household@#%^&*('raised', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'accommodate', 'U')

In an age of specialization, the federal judiciary is one of the last bastions of the generalist.@#%^&*('one', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A judge must jump from murder to antitrust cases, from arson to securities fraud,@#%^&*('jump', 'ROOT', 'R')	
without missing a beat.@#%^&*('missing', 'jump', 'U')	
But even on the federal bench, specialization is creeping in,@#%^&*('creeping', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and it has become a subject of sharp controversy on the newest federal appeals court.@#%^&*('become', 'creeping', 'U')	
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was created in 1982@#%^&*('Court', 'serve', 'U')	('created', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to serve, among other things, as the court of last resort for most patent disputes.@#%^&*('serve', 'created', 'U')	
Previously, patent cases moved through the court system to one of the 12 circuit appeals courts.@#%^&*('moved', 'ROOT', 'R')	
There, judges@#%^&*('There', 'grappled', 'U')	('judges', 'saw', 'U')	('judges', 'had', 'U')	('judges', 'grappled', 'U')	
who saw few such cases@#%^&*('saw', 'judges', 'U')	
and had no experience in the field@#%^&*('had', 'judges', 'U')	('had', 'saw', 'U')	
grappled with some of the most technical and complex disputes imaginable.@#%^&*('grappled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A new specialty court was sought by patent experts,@#%^&*('sought', 'ROOT', 'R')	('experts', 'believed', 'U')	
who believed@#%^&*('believed', 'experts', 'U')	
that the generalists had botched too many important, multimillion-dollar cases.@#%^&*('botched', 'believed', 'U')	
Some patent lawyers had hoped@#%^&*('hoped', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that such a specialty court would be filled with experts in the field.@#%^&*('filled', 'hoped', 'U')	
But the Reagan administration thought otherwise,@#%^&*('thought', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and so may the Bush administration.@#%^&*('may', 'thought', 'U')	
Since 1984, the president has filled four vacancies in the Federal Circuit court with non-patent lawyers.@#%^&*('filled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Now only three of the 12 judges@#%^&*('Now', 'have', 'U')	('three', 'have', 'U')	
-- Pauline Newman, Chief Judge Howard T. Markey, 68, and Giles Rich, 85 --@#%^&*('Newman', 'three', 'U')	('Markey', 'three', 'U')	('68', 'three', 'U')	('Rich', 'three', 'U')	
have patent-law backgrounds.@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The latter two and Judge Daniel M. Friedman, 73, are approaching senior status or retirement.@#%^&*('approaching', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Three seats currently are vacant@#%^&*('vacant', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and three others are likely to be filled within a few years,@#%^&*('likely', 'vacant', 'U')	
so patent lawyers and research-based industries are making a new push@#%^&*('so', 'vacant', 'U')	('making', 'vacant', 'U')	
for specialists to be added to the court.@#%^&*('specialists', 'push', 'U')	('added', 'making', 'U')	
Several organizations,@#%^&*('organizations', 'asked', 'U')	
including the Industrial Biotechnical Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association,@#%^&*('Association', 'organizations', 'U')	('Association', 'organizations', 'U')	
have asked the White House and Justice Department to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds.@#%^&*('asked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The associations would like the court to include between three and six judges with specialized training.@#%^&*('like', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Some of the associations have recommended Dr. Alan D. Lourie, 54, a former patent agent with a doctorate in organic chemistry@#%^&*('recommended', 'ROOT', 'R')	('54', 'counsel', 'U')	
who now is associate general counsel with SmithKline Beckman Corp. in Philadelphia.@#%^&*('counsel', '54', 'U')	
Dr. Lourie says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the Justice Department interviewed him last July.@#%^&*('interviewed', 'says', 'U')	
Their effort has received a lukewarm response from the Justice Department.@#%^&*('received', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"We do not feel@#%^&*('feel', 'says', 'U')	
that seats are reserved@#%^&*('reserved', 'feel', 'U')	
(for patent lawyers),"@#%^&*('for', 'reserved', 'U')	
says Justice spokesman David Runkel,@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Runkel', 'declines', 'U')	
who declines to say@#%^&*('declines', 'Runkel', 'U')	
how soon a candidate will be named.@#%^&*('named', 'say', 'U')	
"But we will take it into consideration."@#%^&*('take', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Justice Department's view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court, Judge H. Robert Mayer, a former civil litigator@#%^&*('shared', 'ROOT', 'R')	('litigator', 'served', 'U')	
who served at the claims court trial level@#%^&*('served', 'litigator', 'U')	
before he was appointed to the Federal Circuit two years ago.@#%^&*('appointed', 'served', 'U')	
"I believe@#%^&*('I', 'make', 'U')	('believe', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law,"@#%^&*('able', 'believe', 'U')	
Judge Mayer says,@#%^&*('says', 'adding', 'U')	
adding@#%^&*('adding', 'law', 'U')	
that "it's the responsibility of highly paid lawyers@#%^&*('responsibility', 'adding', 'U')	
(who argue before the court)@#%^&*('argue', 'believe', 'U')	
to make us understand@#%^&*('make', 'believe', 'U')	
(complex patent litigation)."@#%^&*('litigation', 'understand', 'U')	
Yet some lawyers point to Eli Lilly & Co. vs. Medtronic, Inc., the patent infringement case the@#%^&*('Yet', 'agreed', 'U')	('point', 'agreed', 'U')	('point', 'review', 'U')	('the', 'Court', 'U')	
Supreme Court this month agreed to review, as an example of poor legal reasoning by judges@#%^&*('Court', 'case', 'U')	('month', 'Lilly', 'U')	('agreed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('judges', 'lack', 'U')	
who lack patent litigation experience.@#%^&*('lack', 'judges', 'U')	
(Judge Mayer was not on the three-member panel.)@#%^&*('was', 'construed', 'U')	('the', 'case', 'U')	
In the Lilly case, the appeals court broadly construed a federal statute@#%^&*('construed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to grant Medtronic, a medical device manufacturer, an exemption@#%^&*('grant', 'construed', 'U')	('to', 'infringe', 'U')	
to infringe a patent under certain circumstances.@#%^&*('infringe', 'exemption', 'U')	
If the Supreme Court holds in Medtronic's favor,@#%^&*('holds', 'have', 'U')	('the', 'decision', 'U')	
the decision will have billion-dollar consequences for the manufacturers of medical devices, color and food additives and all other non-drug products@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	('consequences', 'required', 'U')	
that required Food & Drug Administration approval.@#%^&*('required', 'consequences', 'U')	
Lisa Raines, a lawyer and director of government relations for the Industrial Biotechnical Association, contends@#%^&*('contends', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that a judge well-versed in patent law and the concerns of research-based industries would have ruled otherwise.@#%^&*('well', 'contends', 'U')	('ruled', 'contends', 'U')	
And Judge Newman, a former patent lawyer, wrote in her dissent@#%^&*('wrote', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when the court denied a motion for a rehearing of the case by the full court,@#%^&*('denied', 'wrote', 'U')	
"The panel's judicial legislation has affected an important high-technological industry,@#%^&*('affected', 'wrote', 'U')	
without regard to the consequences for research and innovation or the public interest."@#%^&*('regard', 'affected', 'U')	
Says Ms. Raines,@#%^&*('Says', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Raines', 'prove', 'U')	
"(The judgment)@#%^&*('judgment', 'confirms', 'U')	
confirms our concern@#%^&*('confirms', 'Raines', 'U')	
that the absence of patent lawyers on the court could prove troublesome."@#%^&*('prove', 'confirms', 'U')

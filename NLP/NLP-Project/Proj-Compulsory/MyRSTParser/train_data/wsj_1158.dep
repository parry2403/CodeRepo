Medieval philosophers used to hold the sensible belief@#%^&*('used', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist,@#%^&*('perfect', 'hold', 'U')	('a', 'matter', 'U')	
and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all.@#%^&*
Now, only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity;@#%^&*('exists', 'ROOT', 'R')	('it', 'built', 'U')	('is', 'built', 'U')	
it is built into His nature.@#%^&*('built', 'exists', 'U')	
But since the time of Darwin, we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species.@#%^&*('claim', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Aren't we, after all, the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution?@#%^&*('culmination', 'ROOT', 'R')	('evolution', 'give', 'U')	
If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life,@#%^&*('give', 'matter', 'U')	
then it was only a matter of eons@#%^&*('matter', 'called', 'U')	
before splendid beings@#%^&*('before', 'shimmered', 'U')	('beings', 'shimmered', 'U')	
endowed with reason, self-awareness and taste@#%^&*('endowed', 'beings', 'U')	
shimmered onto the scene.@#%^&*('shimmered', 'matter', 'U')	
Now along comes Stephen Jay Gould@#%^&*('comes', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Gould', 'dash', 'U')	
to dash this flattering illusion.@#%^&*('dash', 'comes', 'U')	
His credentials are excellent for the task.@#%^&*('excellent', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Star lecturer at Harvard, author of numerous popular books on science, and scourge of the creationist lobby, Mr. Gould is perhaps the world's most eminent evolutionary theorist.@#%^&*('theorist', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Yet he puts quite a twist on the old story@#%^&*('puts', 'ROOT', 'R')	
handed down from Darwin.@#%^&*('handed', 'story', 'U')	
For him, natural history is anything but a gradual, predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness;@#%^&*('anything', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it is a careening, chaotic affair@#%^&*('affair', 'anything', 'U')	('affair', 'shot', 'U')	
in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a one-in-a-million shot.@#%^&*('shot', 'affair', 'U')	
In "Wonderful Life:@#%^&*('Life', 'makes', 'U')	
The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History"@#%^&*('Shale', 'Life', 'U')	('Nature', 'Life', 'U')	
(Norton, 326 pages, $19.95),@#%^&*('Norton', 'Life', 'U')	
Mr. Gould makes his case for "the awesome improbability of human evolution."@#%^&*('makes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies@#%^&*('turns', 'ROOT', 'R')	('high', 'called', 'U')	
called the Burgess Shale.@#%^&*('called', 'quarry', 'U')	
Here, in an area smaller than a city block, lay buried traces of countless weird creatures@#%^&*('lay', 'ROOT', 'R')	('traces', 'frolicked', 'U')	
that had frolicked more than 500 million years ago -@#%^&*('frolicked', 'traces', 'U')	
- creatures@#%^&*('creatures', 'traces', 'U')	('creatures', 'variety', 'U')	
whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world's oceans today.@#%^&*('exceeded', 'creatures', 'U')	
Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man@#%^&*('inconceivable', 'ROOT', 'R')	('man', 'discovered', 'U')	
who discovered the Burgess Shale, one Charles Doolittle Walcott.@#%^&*('discovered', 'man', 'U')	
The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that animals@#%^&*('that', 'simple', 'U')	('animals', 'simple', 'U')	('animals', 'limited', 'U')	('animals', 'ancestral', 'U')	
living so long ago@#%^&*('living', 'animals', 'U')	
must be simple in design,@#%^&*('simple', 'said', 'U')	
limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species.@#%^&*('limited', 'said', 'U')	('limited', 'simple', 'U')	('ancestral', 'said', 'U')	('ancestral', 'simple', 'U')	
Accordingly, the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the Burgess fossils in such a way@#%^&*('reconstructed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that they could be shoehorned into familiar categories.@#%^&*('shoehorned', 'reconstructed', 'U')	
It was not until the early 1970s that Cambridge Prof. Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale.@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	
By making clever inferences@#%^&*('making', 'able', 'U')	
about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three-dimensional structures,@#%^&*('remains', 'making', 'U')	
this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet.@#%^&*('able', 'ROOT', 'R')	
One was so fantastic in appearance,@#%^&*('fantastic', 'dubbed', 'U')	
it was dubbed Hallucigenia.@#%^&*('dubbed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Would that Mr. Gould's minute descriptions of these creatures was always so colorful.@#%^&*('Would', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A good deal of the book is boring, particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text.@#%^&*('boring', 'ROOT', 'R')	
These turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like, "Most modern chelicerates have six uniramous appendages on the prosoma."@#%^&*('provide', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Interest picks up, though,@#%^&*('picks', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when Mr. Gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution.@#%^&*('gets', 'picks', 'U')	
Not long after the appearance of life, evidently, there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	
seen on the earth.@#%^&*('seen', 'designs', 'U')	
The vast majority of them, however, were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals@#%^&*('wiped', 'ROOT', 'R')	('succession', 'sudden', 'U')	('succession', 'catastrophic', 'U')	('succession', 'operate', 'U')	('were', 'sudden', 'U')	
that were too sudden and catastrophic@#%^&*('sudden', 'succession', 'U')	('catastrophic', 'succession', 'U')	
for the normal rules of natural selection to operate.@#%^&*('rules', 'sudden', 'U')	('operate', 'sudden', 'U')	
Consequently, the winnowing process was like a lottery@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	('lottery', 'held', 'U')	
"in which each group {held} a ticket@#%^&*('held', 'lottery', 'U')	
unrelated to its anatomical virtues."@#%^&*('unrelated', 'ticket', 'U')	
So much for survival of the fittest.@#%^&*('So', 'ROOT', 'R')	
So much, too, for the notion@#%^&*('much', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that we humans triumphed in the Darwinian struggle@#%^&*('triumphed', 'notion', 'U')	
by evolving big brains.@#%^&*('evolving', 'triumphed', 'U')	
Our mammalian forerunners lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact@#%^&*('lucked', 'ROOT', 'R')	('impact', 'did', 'U')	
that did in the dinosaurs@#%^&*('did', 'impact', 'U')	
because they were small, not smart.@#%^&*('smart', 'did', 'U')	
If anyone has difficulty imagining a world@#%^&*('has', 'sketches', 'U')	('world', 'went', 'U')	
in which history went merrily on without us,@#%^&*('went', 'world', 'U')	
Mr. Gould sketches several.@#%^&*('sketches', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In one, birds are the dominant carnivores;@#%^&*('carnivores', 'ROOT', 'R')	
in another the seas abound with "little penises."@#%^&*('abound', 'carnivores', 'U')	
Back when the Burgess fauna were flourishing,@#%^&*('Back', 'hung', 'U')	
it seems,@#%^&*('seems', 'hung', 'U')	
human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone@#%^&*('hung', 'ROOT', 'R')	
called Pikaia.@#%^&*('called', 'backbone', 'U')	
Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating;@#%^&*('finds', 'ROOT', 'R')	
like an existentialist of old, he views our contingency as "a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility."@#%^&*('views', 'finds', 'U')	
I, by contrast, cannot help feeling@#%^&*('help', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that if some other curiosity from the Burgess Shale had survived instead,@#%^&*('that', 'gained', 'U')	('survived', 'gained', 'U')	
beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion.@#%^&*('gained', 'feeling', 'U')	
But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all,@#%^&*('evolved', 'place', 'U')	
the universe is a big place,@#%^&*('universe', 'sympathetic', 'U')	('place', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and given the right conditions,@#%^&*('given', 'sympathetic', 'U')	
sympathetic to creating some form of life.@#%^&*('sympathetic', 'place', 'U')	
Surely at some other cosmic address a Gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze@#%^&*('Surely', 'life', 'U')	('risen', 'life', 'U')	
to explain why,@#%^&*('explain', 'ooze', 'U')	
paleontologically speaking,@#%^&*('speaking', 'risen', 'U')	
"it is, indeed, a wonderful life."@#%^&*('life', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Holt is a columnist for the Literary Review in London.@#%^&*('columnist', 'ROOT', 'R')

but ABC's Ted Koppel came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week@#%^&*('came', 'heard', 'U')	
when he asked Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz@#%^&*('asked', 'came', 'U')	
if Prop. 13 had withheld money@#%^&*('withheld', 'asked', 'U')	
needed for road maintenance.@#%^&*('needed', 'money', 'U')

even while the price of gasoline has fallen.@#%^&*('fallen', 'raised', 'U')

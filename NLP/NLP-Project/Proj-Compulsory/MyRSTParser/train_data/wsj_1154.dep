Ms. Gruberova last week did many things nicely and others not so well.@#%^&*('did', 'ROOT', 'R')

There are times@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	('times', 'show', 'U')

She has TB, after all, and a weak-kneed lover;@#%^&*('has', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'courtesan', 'U')	
and though a successful courtesan, she is just about overdrawn at the bank.@#%^&*('overdrawn', 'has', 'U')

Seeing all those millions in action,@#%^&*('Seeing', 'relieved', 'U')

didn't accidentally smother herself in a drape.@#%^&*('smother', 'relieved', 'U')	
Large and lavish, "Traviata" is another addition to the Met's growing stock of cast-proof productions mostly by Mr. Zeffirelli.@#%^&*('addition', 'ROOT', 'R')	
They have a life of their own@#%^&*('They', 'counted', 'U')	('They', 'look', 'U')	('have', 'ROOT', 'R')

Or is it that Mr. Z. is getting a little tired of "Traviata"?@#%^&*('it', 'ROOT', 'R')	
This is the same production@#%^&*('production', 'it', 'U')

who so often cancels@#%^&*('cancels', 'nerves', 'U')	
offered a limpid, flowing performance@#%^&*('offered', 'ROOT', 'R')	('performance', 'was', 'U')	
that in its unswagged and unswaggering approach was totally at odds with the staging.@#%^&*('was', 'performance', 'U')	
Of heart-pounding moments there were nearly none,@#%^&*('were', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and whether this has to do with Mr. Kleiber or the wooden cast is hard to say.@#%^&*('hard', 'were', 'U')	
In any event, Ms. Gruberova barely ventilated Violetta's anguish in her long meeting with Wolfgang Brendel,@#%^&*('ventilated', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Brendel', 'seemed', 'U')	
who as Germont seemed fairly desperate@#%^&*('seemed', 'Brendel', 'U')

The cancellation bodes poorly for a company@#%^&*('bodes', 'ROOT', 'R')

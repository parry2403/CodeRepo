At age eight, Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman's house@#%^&*('sent', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'do', 'U')	
to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep@#%^&*('do', 'house', 'U')	
-- a place in the basement with the coal.@#%^&*
At age 19, she was a Paris sensation,@#%^&*('sensation', 'ROOT', 'R')	
transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade.@#%^&*('transformed', 'sensation', 'U')	
It is the stuff of dreams, but also of traumas.@#%^&*('stuff', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Only the bravest spirits survive such roller coasters.@#%^&*('survive', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And, for Ms. Baker, the ride was far from over.@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Her bare breasts, her dancing, her voice, her beauty and, perhaps most famously, her derriere, were prominent attractions,@#%^&*('attractions', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible.@#%^&*('made', 'attractions', 'U')	
Bricktop, another American black woman@#%^&*('Bricktop', 'said', 'U')	('woman', 'found', 'U')	
who found a measure of fame in Paris,@#%^&*('found', 'woman', 'U')	
said:@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"I don't think@#%^&*('think', 'said', 'U')	('I', 'known', 'U')	
I've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life,@#%^&*('known', 'think', 'U')	
or whose life was more complicated than Josephine's."@#%^&*('complicated', 'think', 'U')	('complicated', 'known', 'U')	
Men were a constant complication.@#%^&*('complication', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Baker had lots of them.@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But she didn't trust them@#%^&*('she', 'reward', 'U')	('trust', 'ROOT', 'R')	('did', 'reward', 'U')	("n't", 'reward', 'U')	
and didn't reward trust.@#%^&*
As she saw one key love affair,@#%^&*('saw', 'infidelity', 'U')	
the problem wasn't her infidelity,@#%^&*('infidelity', 'jealousy', 'U')	('it', 'jealousy', 'U')	('was', 'jealousy', 'U')	
it was his jealousy.@#%^&*('jealousy', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Her appetite for children also was large.@#%^&*('large', 'ROOT', 'R')	
She adopted 12 of assorted races,@#%^&*('adopted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
naming them the Rainbow Tribe,@#%^&*('naming', 'adopted', 'U')	
and driving her husband first to despair and then to Argentina.@#%^&*('driving', 'adopted', 'U')	('driving', 'naming', 'U')	
She made money,@#%^&*('She', 'spent', 'U')	('made', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but spent more.@#%^&*('spent', 'made', 'U')	
Friends pitched in.@#%^&*('pitched', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Finally, Prince Rainier and Princess Grace saved her with the offer of a house in Monaco.@#%^&*('saved', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Another lifelong complication,@#%^&*('complication', 'racism', 'U')	
as Phyllis Rose makes clear in "Jazz Cleopatra:@#%^&*('makes', 'complication', 'U')	('Cleopatra', 'Doubleday', 'U')	
Josephine Baker in Her Time"@#%^&*('Baker', 'Cleopatra', 'U')	
(Doubleday, 321 pages, $22.50),@#%^&*('Doubleday', 'clear', 'U')	
was racism.@#%^&*('racism', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Baker had the good luck@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to arrive in 1925 Paris,@#%^&*('arrive', 'luck', 'U')	
where blacks had become exotic.@#%^&*('become', 'Paris', 'U')	
African art was in vogue@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age@#%^&*('writing', 'was', 'U')	
to be inspired by blacks.@#%^&*('inspired', 'age', 'U')	
To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized,@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world.@#%^&*
Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater,@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line@#%^&*('judged', 'had', 'U')	
(performing of course for all-white audiences).@#%^&*('performing', 'line', 'U')	
Paris loved her at first sight.@#%^&*('loved', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"She just wiggled her fanny@#%^&*('wiggled', 'sniffed', 'U')	
and all the French fell in love with her,"@#%^&*('all', 'wiggled', 'U')	('all', 'wiggled', 'U')	('all', 'sniffed', 'U')	('fell', 'wiggled', 'U')	
sniffed the literary world's Maria Jolas, not entirely inaccurately.@#%^&*('sniffed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end,"@#%^&*('overemphasize', 'writes', 'U')	
Ms. Rose writes.@#%^&*('writes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Ms. Rose,@#%^&*('Rose', 'teaches', 'U')	('Rose', 'proceeds', 'U')	('Rose', 'overemphasize', 'U')	
who teaches literature at Wesleyan University,@#%^&*('teaches', 'Rose', 'U')	
quickly proceeds to overemphasize,@#%^&*('proceeds', 'ROOT', 'R')	
claiming@#%^&*('claiming', 'proceeds', 'U')	
that Baker's dancing "had uncovered a new region for desire"@#%^&*('uncovered', 'claiming', 'U')	
and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous.@#%^&*('ignoring', 'proceeds', 'U')	('ignoring', 'claiming', 'U')	
"Jazz Cleopatra" contains other, more important, false notes@#%^&*('contains', 'ROOT', 'R')	('notes', 'undermine', 'U')	
that undermine what is, for the most part, a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works.@#%^&*('undermine', 'notes', 'U')	
It is easy to see why Baker, a free spirit@#%^&*('easy', 'attracts', 'U')	('why', 'places', 'U')	('Baker', 'places', 'U')	('spirit', 'broke', 'U')	
who broke many of the restraints@#%^&*('broke', 'spirit', 'U')	('the', 'convention', 'U')	('restraints', 'convention', 'U')	
convention places on women,@#%^&*('convention', 'many', 'U')	('places', 'see', 'U')	
attracts Ms. Rose, the author of "Parallel Lives," a wonderful study of Victorian marriage.@#%^&*('attracts', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Still, even the title raises questions about the author's vision of her subject.@#%^&*('raises', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Baker's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term.@#%^&*('jazz', 'ROOT', 'R')	
To find parallels, other than sexual appeal, with Cleopatra, requires an equal stretch.@#%^&*('requires', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Baker was 68 years old@#%^&*('old', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when she died in Paris, two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show:@#%^&*('a', 'ending', 'U')	
a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life.@#%^&*('ending', 'show', 'U')	
In fact, Ms. Baker played scenes in Casablanca@#%^&*('played', 'ROOT', 'R')	('scenes', 'made', 'U')	
that could have made it into "Casablanca."@#%^&*('made', 'scenes', 'U')	
During World War II, her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion@#%^&*('view', 'resisted', 'U')	('led', 'made', 'U')	
that the Nazis were evil@#%^&*('evil', 'led', 'U')	
and must be resisted,@#%^&*('resisted', 'led', 'U')	('resisted', 'made', 'U')	('a', 'decision', 'U')	
a decision@#%^&*('decision', 'made', 'U')	
made by only about 2% of French citizens.@#%^&*('made', 'ROOT', 'R')	
She was devoted to Charles de Gaulle's cause,@#%^&*('devoted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk@#%^&*('accepting', 'devoted', 'U')	('sacrifice', 'become', 'U')	('risk', 'become', 'U')	
to become first a spy and then a one-woman USO tour for the forces of Free France.@#%^&*('become', 'accepting', 'U')

Ms. Rose is best on the early years and World War II.@#%^&*('best', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In her introduction, Ms. Rose writes@#%^&*('introduction', 'seems', 'U')	('writes', 'seems', 'U')	
that she feels@#%^&*('feels', 'writes', 'U')	('feels', 'writes', 'U')	('she', 'has', 'U')	
she has much in common with Baker,@#%^&*('has', 'feels', 'U')	('as', 'goes', 'U')	
but as "Jazz Cleopatra" goes on,@#%^&*('goes', 'writes', 'U')	('goes', 'writes', 'U')	('goes', 'feels', 'U')	
it seems more rushed,@#%^&*('seems', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as though the author were growing less interested.@#%^&*('growing', 'seems', 'U')	
It doesn't help that sometimes Ms. Rose's language fails to deliver the effect@#%^&*('help', 'ROOT', 'R')	
she appears to want.@#%^&*('appears', 'effect', 'U')	
One chapter opens:@#%^&*('opens', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"World War II was not one of France's glorious moments."@#%^&*('one', 'opens', 'U')	
Elsewhere, in an attempt@#%^&*('Elsewhere', 'writes', 'U')	('attempt', 'writes', 'U')	
to explain@#%^&*('explain', 'attempt', 'U')	
without stating it plainly@#%^&*('stating', 'explain', 'U')	
that Baker had a large gay following later in her career@#%^&*('had', 'stating', 'U')	
when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer,@#%^&*('singer', 'had', 'U')	('dancer', 'had', 'U')	
Ms. Rose writes:@#%^&*('writes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"She was a female impersonator@#%^&*('impersonator', 'writes', 'U')	('impersonator', 'happened', 'U')	('impersonator', 'woman', 'U')

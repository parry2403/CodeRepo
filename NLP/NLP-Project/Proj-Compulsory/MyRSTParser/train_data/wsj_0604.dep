Kidder, Peabody & Co. is trying to struggle back.@#%^&*('trying', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Only a few months ago, the 124-year-old securities firm seemed to be on the verge of a meltdown,@#%^&*('firm', 'racked', 'U')	('seemed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'racked', 'U')	('be', 'racked', 'U')	('verge', 'racked', 'U')	
racked by internal squabbles and defections.@#%^&*('racked', 'seemed', 'U')	
Its relationship with parent General Electric Co. had been frayed since a big Kidder insider-trading scandal two years ago.@#%^&*('frayed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Chief executives and presidents had come and gone.@#%^&*('come', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Now, the firm says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it's at a turning point.@#%^&*("'s", 'says', 'U')	
By the end of this year, 63-year-old Chairman Silas Cathcart@#%^&*('end', 'retires', 'U')	('Cathcart', 'retires', 'U')	('Cathcart', 'build', 'U')	('the', 'chairman', 'U')	
-- the former chairman of Illinois Tool Works@#%^&*('chairman', 'Cathcart', 'U')	('Works', 'derided', 'U')	
who was derided as a "tool-and-die man"@#%^&*('derided', 'Works', 'U')	('man', 'brought', 'U')	('man', 'brought', 'U')	
when GE brought him in@#%^&*('brought', 'man', 'U')	
to clean up Kidder in 1987 --@#%^&*('clean', 'brought', 'U')	
retires to his Lake Forest, Ill., home,@#%^&*('retires', 'ROOT', 'R')	
possibly to build a shopping mall on some land@#%^&*('build', 'retires', 'U')	
he owns.@#%^&*('owns', 'land', 'U')	
"I've done what I came to do" at Kidder,@#%^&*('done', 'says', 'U')	
he says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And that means 42-year-old Michael Carpenter, president and chief executive since January, will for the first time take complete control of Kidder@#%^&*('means', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Carpenter', 'try', 'U')	('Carpenter', 'make', 'U')	
and try to make good on some grandiose plans.@#%^&*('try', 'means', 'U')	('try', 'take', 'U')	
Mr. Carpenter says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
he will return Kidder to prominence as a great investment bank.@#%^&*('return', 'says', 'U')	
Wall Street is understandably skeptical.@#%^&*('skeptical', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Through the first nine months of the year, Kidder ranks a distant 10th among underwriters of U.S. stocks and bonds, with a 2.8% market share, up slightly from 2.5% in the year-earlier period,@#%^&*('ranks', 'ROOT', 'R')	
according to Securities Data Co.@#%^&*('Co.', 'ranks', 'U')	
It's quite a fall from the early 1980s,@#%^&*('fall', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when Kidder still was counted as an investment-banking powerhouse.@#%^&*('counted', '1980s', 'U')	
Gary S. Goldstein, president of the Whitney Group, an executive search firm, said:@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"I'd like to see (Kidder) succeed.@#%^&*('like', 'said', 'U')	
But they have to attract good senior bankers@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	('bankers', 'bring', 'U')	
who can bring in the business from day one."@#%^&*('bring', 'bankers', 'U')	
In 1988, Kidder eked out a $46 million profit,@#%^&*('eked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
mainly because of severe cost cutting.@#%^&*('mainly', 'eked', 'U')	('cost', 'eked', 'U')	
Its 1,400-member brokerage operation reported an estimated $5 million loss last year,@#%^&*('reported', 'ROOT', 'R')	
although Kidder expects it to turn a profit this year.@#%^&*('expects', 'reported', 'U')	
In fact, Kidder is a minor player in just about every business@#%^&*('player', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it does@#%^&*('does', 'player', 'U')	
except computer-driven program trading;@#%^&*('trading', 'does', 'U')	
in that controversial business, only Morgan Stanley & Co. rivals Kidder.@#%^&*('rivals', 'player', 'U')	
But even that niche is under attack,@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as several Wall Street firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors.@#%^&*('pulled', 'is', 'U')	
Mr. Carpenter, a former consulting-firm executive@#%^&*('Carpenter', 'says', 'U')	('executive', 'has', 'U')	
who has a love for "task forces,"@#%^&*('has', 'executive', 'U')	
says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
he has done a "complete rethink" of Kidder in recent months.@#%^&*('done', 'says', 'U')	
There have been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm's operations.@#%^&*('parade', 'ROOT', 'R')	
More than 20 new managing directors and senior vice presidents have been hired since January.@#%^&*('hired', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The firm's brokerage force has been trimmed@#%^&*('trimmed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and its mergers-and-acquisitions staff increased to a record 55 people.@#%^&*('increased', 'trimmed', 'U')	
Mr. Carpenter says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that@#%^&*('that', 'tap', 'U')	
when he assumes full control,@#%^&*('assumes', 'tap', 'U')	
Kidder will finally tap the resources of GE.@#%^&*('tap', 'says', 'U')	
One of GE's goals@#%^&*('One', 'was', 'U')	('One', 'take', 'U')	('goals', 'bought', 'U')	
when it bought 80% of Kidder in 1986@#%^&*('bought', 'GE', 'U')	('bought', 'goals', 'U')	
was to take advantage of "syngeries" between Kidder and General Electric Capital Corp., GE's corporate-finance unit,@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Corp.', 'has', 'U')	
which has $42 billion in assets.@#%^&*('has', 'Corp.', 'U')	
The leveraged buy-out group of GE Capital now reports to Mr. Carpenter.@#%^&*('reports', 'ROOT', 'R')	
So far,@#%^&*('So', 'bickered', 'U')	
instead of teaming up,@#%^&*('teaming', 'bickered', 'U')	
GE Capital staffers and Kidder investment bankers have bickered.@#%^&*('bickered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Yet,@#%^&*('Yet', 'says', 'U')	
says Mr. Carpenter,@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"We've really started to exploit the synergy between GE Capital and Kidder Peabody."@#%^&*('started', 'says', 'U')	
The units have worked on 37 investment banking deals this year,@#%^&*('worked', 'ROOT', 'R')	('he', 'says', 'U')	
he says,@#%^&*('says', 'worked', 'U')	
though not all of them have panned out.@#%^&*('panned', 'worked', 'U')	
"We've had a good relationship with GE,@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	('GE', 'time', 'U')	
which is the first time@#%^&*('time', 'GE', 'U')	('time', 'say', 'U')	
you could say that@#%^&*('say', 'time', 'U')	
-- uh, let me withdraw that.@#%^&*('let', 'had', 'U')	
It's been a steadily improving relationship,"@#%^&*('relationship', 'says', 'U')	
says Mr. Carpenter.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Still,@#%^&*('Still', 'left', 'U')	
without many actual deals@#%^&*('deals', 'left', 'U')	
to show off,@#%^&*('show', 'deals', 'U')	
Kidder is left to stress@#%^&*('left', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that it finally has "a team" in place,@#%^&*('has', 'stress', 'U')	('that', 'works', 'U')	
and that everyone works harder.@#%^&*('works', 'stress', 'U')	('works', 'has', 'U')	
A month ago, the firm started serving dinner at about 7:30 each night;@#%^&*('started', 'ROOT', 'R')	('about', '60', 'U')	
about 50 to 60 of the 350 people in the investment banking operation have consistently been around that late.@#%^&*('been', 'started', 'U')	
"We are working significantly longer and harder@#%^&*('working', 'says', 'U')	
than has been the case in the past,"@#%^&*('case', 'longer', 'U')	
says Scott C. Newquist, Kidder's head of investment banking since June.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Everywhere, Kidder stresses the "always working" theme.@#%^&*('stresses', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A new in-house magazine, Kidder World@#%^&*('magazine', 'confides', 'U')	
-- which will focus on the firm's synergy strategy,@#%^&*('focus', 'magazine', 'U')	
says Mr. Carpenter --@#%^&*('says', 'strategy', 'U')	
confides@#%^&*('confides', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that on weekends Mr. Newquist "often gets value-added ideas@#%^&*('gets', 'confides', 'U')	
while flying his single-engine Cessna Centurion on the way to Nantucket."@#%^&*('flying', 'gets', 'U')	
The firm's new head of mergers and acquisitions under Mr. Newquist, B.J. Megargel, talks of the opportunity@#%^&*('talks', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to "rebuild a franchise" at Kidder.@#%^&*('rebuild', 'opportunity', 'U')	
"The Kidder name is one of only six or seven@#%^&*('one', 'says', 'U')	
that every CEO recognizes as a viable alternative"@#%^&*('recognizes', 'one', 'U')	
when considering a merger deal,@#%^&*('considering', 'recognizes', 'U')	('he', 'says', 'U')	
he says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Now,@#%^&*('Now', 'has', 'U')	
according to a Kidder World story about Mr. Megargel,@#%^&*('to', 'has', 'U')	('story', 'has', 'U')	
all the firm has to do is "position ourselves more in the deal flow."@#%^&*('has', 'ROOT', 'R')	
With investment banking as Kidder's "lead business," where do Kidder's 42-branch brokerage network and its 1,400 brokers fit in?@#%^&*('fit', 'sold', 'U')	
Mr. Carpenter this month sold off Kidder's eight brokerage offices in Florida and Puerto Rico to Merrill Lynch & Co.,@#%^&*('sold', 'ROOT', 'R')	
refueling speculation@#%^&*('refueling', 'sold', 'U')	
that Kidder is getting out of the brokerage business entirely.@#%^&*('getting', 'sold', 'U')	
Mr. Carpenter denies the speculation.@#%^&*('denies', 'ROOT', 'R')	
To answer the brokerage question,@#%^&*('answer', 'completed', 'U')	
Kidder, in typical fashion, completed a task-force study.@#%^&*('completed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The result:@#%^&*('result', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Kidder will focus on rich individual investors and small companies, much closer to the clientele of Goldman, Sachs & Co. than a serve-the-world firm like Merrill Lynch or Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.@#%^&*('focus', 'result', 'U')	
Mr. Carpenter notes@#%^&*('notes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that these types of investors also are "sophisticated" enough@#%^&*('sophisticated', 'notes', 'U')	
not to complain about Kidder's aggressive use of program trading.@#%^&*('complain', 'sophisticated', 'U')	
As part of the upscale push, Kidder is putting brokers through a 20-week training course,@#%^&*('putting', 'ROOT', 'R')	
turning them into "investment counselors" with knowledge of corporate finance.@#%^&*('turning', 'putting', 'U')	
They will get "new and improved tools@#%^&*('get', 'says', 'U')	('to', 'sell', 'U')	
to sell, particularly to the affluent investor,"@#%^&*('sell', 'get', 'U')	
says brokerage chief Charles V. Sheehan.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Theoretically, the brokers will then be able to funnel "leads" on corporate finance opportunities to Kidder's investment bankers,@#%^&*('able', 'ROOT', 'R')	
possibly easing the longstanding tension between the two camps.@#%^&*('easing', 'able', 'U')	
However, skeptics caution@#%^&*('caution', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that this kind of cross-pollination between brokers and investment bankers looks great on paper,@#%^&*('kind', 'happen', 'U')	('looks', 'caution', 'U')	
but doesn't always happen.@#%^&*('happen', 'caution', 'U')	('happen', 'looks', 'U')	
Kidder competitors aren't outwardly hostile to the firm,@#%^&*('hostile', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as many are to a tough competitor like Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.@#%^&*('are', 'hostile', 'U')	
that doesn't have Kidder's long history.@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	
However, competitors say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Kidder's hiring binge@#%^&*('that', 'backfire', 'U')	('binge', 'backfire', 'U')	
involving executive-level staffers, some with multiple-year contract guarantees,@#%^&*('involving', 'binge', 'U')	
could backfire@#%^&*('backfire', 'say', 'U')	
unless there are results.@#%^&*('are', 'backfire', 'U')	
The departing Mr. Cathcart says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	('he', 'has', 'U')	
he has no worries about Kidder's future.@#%^&*('has', 'says', 'U')	
Mr. Cathcart,@#%^&*('Cathcart', 'return', 'U')	('Cathcart', 'credited', 'U')	
who will return to the Quaker Oats Co. board of directors,@#%^&*('return', 'Cathcart', 'U')	
in addition to his personal ventures, is credited with bringing some basic budgeting and planning discipline to traditionally free-wheeling Kidder.@#%^&*('ventures', 'return', 'U')	('ventures', 'board', 'U')	('credited', 'ROOT', 'R')	
He also improved the firm's compliance procedures for trading.@#%^&*('improved', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Cathcart says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
he has had "a lot of fun" at Kidder,@#%^&*('had', 'says', 'U')	
adding@#%^&*('adding', 'says', 'U')	
the crack@#%^&*('crack', 'adding', 'U')	
about his being a "tool-and-die man"@#%^&*('being', 'crack', 'U')	('man', 'adding', 'U')	
never bothered him.@#%^&*('bothered', 'man', 'U')	
"It was an absolutely marvelous line and one@#%^&*('line', 'says', 'U')	('one', 'says', 'U')	('I', 'used', 'U')	
I used many times,"@#%^&*('used', 'one', 'U')	
he says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Smiling broadly@#%^&*('Smiling', 'says', 'U')	
when he talks about Mr. Carpenter,@#%^&*('talks', 'Smiling', 'U')	('Mr.', 'Cathcart', 'U')	
Mr. Cathcart says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the new Kidder chief is "going to be recognized shortly as one of the real leaders in the investment-banking business."@#%^&*('going', 'says', 'U')	
In coming years,@#%^&*('years', 'gon', 'U')	
Mr. Cathcart says,@#%^&*('says', 'gon', 'U')	
Kidder is "gonna hum."@#%^&*('gon', 'ROOT', 'R')

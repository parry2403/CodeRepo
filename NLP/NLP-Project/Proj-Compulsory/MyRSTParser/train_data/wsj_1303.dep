the speed of his promotion surprised many.@#%^&*('surprised', 'ROOT', 'R')

that does very well in its domestic market@#%^&*('does', 'reins', 'U')	('that', 'seeking', 'U')	('that', 'realize', 'U')	
but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing.@#%^&*('seeking', 'reins', 'U')	('seeking', 'does', 'U')

to make its international operations more profitable@#%^&*('make', 'interpreted', 'U')	('operations', 'preparing', 'U')	('profitable', 'preparing', 'U')	
while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of Japan's domestic markets,@#%^&*('preparing', 'make', 'U')	('markets', 'mean', 'U')	
which should mean increased competition.@#%^&*('mean', 'markets', 'U')

And@#%^&*('And', 'shown', 'U')	
while the Japanese have stepped up their purchases of U.S. shares in the past several months,@#%^&*('stepped', 'shown', 'U')	
they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors.@#%^&*('shown', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At the same time, Daiwa and its brethren have faced stiff competition from well-entrenched American competitors@#%^&*('faced', 'ROOT', 'R')	('competitors', 'prevented', 'U')	('have', 'prevented', 'U')	
that have prevented them from building strong links to U.S. corporations and institutional investors.@#%^&*('prevented', 'competitors', 'U')

In an interview a few months ago, he recalled@#%^&*('recalled', 'ROOT', 'R')

to sell portions of 20 U.S. corporate bond issues.@#%^&*('sell', 'bid', 'U')	
But he couldn't sell any.@#%^&*('sell', 'ROOT', 'R')

Undaunted, Mr. Dozen said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Daiwa's goal is to build "a high-technology oriented international organization with maybe some Japanese flavor to it."@#%^&*('is', 'said', 'U')	
He said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures, options, mortgaged-backed securities, computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions.@#%^&*('interested', 'said', 'U')	
Mr. Dozen said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Daiwa's strengths were its large capital base, its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors.@#%^&*('base', 'said', 'U')	('position', 'said', 'U')	('links', 'said', 'U')	
Mr. Dozen joined Daiwa upon his graduation from Kyoto University in 1959.@#%^&*('joined', 'ROOT', 'R')

he is very well-balanced,"@#%^&*('well', 'picking', 'U')	
said Takuro Isoda, chairman of Daiwa's U.S. unit in New York.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But it Mr. Dozen's experience as a salesman@#%^&*('experience', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that enabled him to gain the political support@#%^&*('enabled', 'experience', 'U')	
-- particularly from the retail sales force --@#%^&*('from', 'gain', 'U')	
to accede to the presidency.@#%^&*('accede', 'gain', 'U')	
Commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of Japanese securities companies' earnings.@#%^&*('form', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And anybody@#%^&*('And', 'fragile', 'U')	('anybody', 'lacked', 'U')	('anybody', 'fragile', 'U')	
who lacked the backing of the retail sales force@#%^&*('lacked', 'anybody', 'U')	
"would be fragile,"@#%^&*('fragile', 'said', 'U')	
said a Daiwa executive.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
If Mr. Dozen has a weakness,@#%^&*('has', 'game', 'U')	
it may be his golf game.@#%^&*('game', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"He digs in the sand@#%^&*('digs', 'said', 'U')	
instead of hitting the ball,@#%^&*('hitting', 'sand', 'U')	('a', 'farmer', 'U')

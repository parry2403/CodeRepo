GM trimmed about 40 firms from its approved local counsel list,@#%^&*('trimmed', 'says', 'U')	
Mr. Pearce says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The move is consistent with a trend@#%^&*('move', 'do', 'U')	('consistent', 'ROOT', 'R')

Mr. Pearce set up GM's first in-house litigation group in May with four lawyers, all former assistant U.S. attorneys with extensive trial experience.@#%^&*('set', 'ROOT', 'R')

Among the types of cases@#%^&*('types', 'handle', 'U')	('the', 'litigators', 'U')	
the in-house litigators handle@#%^&*('handle', 'ROOT', 'R')

FEDERAL PROSECUTORS are concluding fewer criminal cases with trials.@#%^&*('concluding', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That's a finding of a new study of the Justice Department by researchers at Syracuse University.@#%^&*('finding', 'ROOT', 'R')	
David Burnham, one of the authors, says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
fewer trials probably means a growing number of plea bargains.@#%^&*('means', 'says', 'U')	
In 1980, 18% of federal prosecutions concluded at trial;@#%^&*('concluded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
in 1987, only 9% did.@#%^&*('did', 'concluded', 'U')	
The study covered 11 major U.S. attorneys' offices@#%^&*('covered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- including those in Manhattan and Brooklyn, N.Y., and New Jersey --@#%^&*('including', 'covered', 'U')	
from 1980 to 1987.@#%^&*('1987', 'covered', 'U')	
The Justice Department rejected the implication@#%^&*('rejected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that its prosecutors are currently more willing to plea bargain.@#%^&*('willing', 'rejected', 'U')	
"Our felony caseloads have been consistent for 20 years,"@#%^&*('consistent', 'said', 'U')	
with about 15% of all prosecutions going to trial,@#%^&*('%', 'consistent', 'U')	('a', 'spokeswoman', 'U')	
a department spokeswoman said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The discrepancy is somewhat perplexing in that the Syracuse researchers said@#%^&*('perplexing', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they based their conclusions on government statistics.@#%^&*('based', 'said', 'U')	
"One possible explanation for this decline"@#%^&*
in taking cases to trial,@#%^&*('taking', 'decline', 'U')	
says Mr. Burnham,@#%^&*('says', 'is', 'U')	
"is that the number of defendants@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	('that', 'increased', 'U')	('number', 'increased', 'U')	
being charged with crimes by all U.S. attorneys@#%^&*('charged', 'defendants', 'U')	
has substantially increased."@#%^&*('increased', 'is', 'U')	
In 1980,@#%^&*('1980', 'says', 'U')	
the study says,@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')

aged 18 years and older.@#%^&*('aged', 'people', 'U')	('older', 'surveyed', 'U')	('older', 'filed', 'U')

Another finding from the study:@#%^&*('finding', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Prosecutors set significantly different priorities.@#%^&*('Prosecutors', 'finding', 'U')	
The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office stressed criminal cases from 1980 to 1987,@#%^&*('stressed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
averaging 43 for every 100,000 adults.@#%^&*('averaging', 'stressed', 'U')	
But the New Jersey U.S. attorney averaged 16.@#%^&*('averaged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
On the civil side, the Manhattan prosecutor filed an average of only 11 cases for every 100,000 adults during the same period;@#%^&*('filed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'attorney', 'U')	
the San Francisco U.S. attorney averaged 79.@#%^&*('averaged', 'filed', 'U')

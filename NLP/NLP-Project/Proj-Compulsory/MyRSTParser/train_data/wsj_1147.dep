The House approved a short-term spending bill@#%^&*('approved', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to keep the government operating through Nov. 15@#%^&*('keep', 'approved', 'U')	
and provide $2.85 billion in emergency funds@#%^&*('provide', 'approved', 'U')	('provide', 'keep', 'U')	
to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake.@#%^&*('assist', 'provide', 'U')	
The 321-99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance,@#%^&*('reflected', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'cost', 'U')	
but the cost to the Treasury is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.@#%^&*('sure', 'reflected', 'U')	
By a lopsided 401-18 margin, the chamber rejected an effort@#%^&*('rejected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to waive Gramm-Rudman for purposes@#%^&*('waive', 'effort', 'U')	
of addressing the two disasters,@#%^&*('addressing', 'purposes', 'U')	
and budget analysts estimate@#%^&*('estimate', 'rejected', 'U')	
the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $1.44 billion@#%^&*('widen', 'estimate', 'U')	
unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by Congress.@#%^&*('found', 'widen', 'U')	
The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991,@#%^&*('greater', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and the issue forced a confrontation between the Appropriations Committee leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta,@#%^&*('forced', 'greater', 'U')	('Panetta', 'district', 'U')	
whose California district was at the center of the earthquake last week.@#%^&*('week', 'Panetta', 'U')	
Going to the well of the chamber,@#%^&*('Going', 'demanded', 'U')	
Mr. Panetta demanded@#%^&*('demanded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the costs be fully counted.@#%^&*('counted', 'demanded', 'U')	
His prominent role put him in the awkward position@#%^&*('put', 'ROOT', 'R')	
of challenging the very committee members@#%^&*('challenging', 'position', 'U')	
on whom his state will be most dependent in the months ahead.@#%^&*('dependent', 'challenging', 'U')	
"We do not come to this House@#%^&*('come', 'said', 'U')	
asking for any handout,"@#%^&*('asking', 'House', 'U')	
said the California Democrat.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"We do not intend to hide these costs from the American people."@#%^&*('intend', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The $2.85 billion package incorporates $500 million for low-interest disaster loans, $1 billion in highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion@#%^&*('incorporates', 'ROOT', 'R')	
divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve@#%^&*('divided', '$', 'U')	
to be available to President Bush@#%^&*('available', 'divided', 'U')	('to', 'meet', 'U')	
to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters.@#%^&*('meet', 'available', 'U')	
The funds are in addition to $1.1 billion@#%^&*('funds', 'appropriated', 'U')	('are', 'appropriated', 'U')	('$', 'appropriated', 'U')	
appropriated last month@#%^&*('appropriated', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to assist in the recovery from Hugo,@#%^&*('assist', 'appropriated', 'U')	
bringing the total for the two disasters to nearly $4 billion in unanticipated spending.@#%^&*('bringing', 'assist', 'U')	
Because of the vagaries of Gramm-Rudman,@#%^&*('of', 'small', 'U')	('vagaries', 'small', 'U')	('the', 'impact', 'U')	
the immediate impact is relatively small.@#%^&*('small', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the appropriations set in motion spending@#%^&*('set', 'ROOT', 'R')	('spending', 'adds', 'U')	
that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991.@#%^&*('adds', 'spending', 'U')	
Within the appropriations process, the situation is even more difficult@#%^&*('difficult', 'ROOT', 'R')	
since the costs will be counted against the share of funds@#%^&*('costs', 'allocated', 'U')	('counted', 'difficult', 'U')	
to be allocated to those subcommittees@#%^&*('allocated', 'counted', 'U')	('subcommittees', 'had', 'U')	
that recently have had the greatest difficulty@#%^&*('had', 'subcommittees', 'U')	
in staying within the budget.@#%^&*('staying', 'had', 'U')	
The underlying bill@#%^&*('bill', 'required', 'U')	('bill', 'keep', 'U')	
approved yesterday@#%^&*('approved', 'bill', 'U')	
is required@#%^&*('required', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to keep the government operating past midnight tonight,@#%^&*('keep', 'required', 'U')	
and this urgency has contributed to the speed@#%^&*('contributed', 'required', 'U')	('speed', 'accompanied', 'U')	
-- and, critics say, mistakes --@#%^&*('say', 'speed', 'U')	('mistakes', 'contributed', 'U')	('mistakes', 'speed', 'U')	('mistakes', 'accompanied', 'U')	
that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance.@#%^&*('accompanied', 'speed', 'U')	
The hastily drafted measure could hurt California@#%^&*('hurt', 'ROOT', 'R')	
by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance@#%^&*('requiring', 'hurt', 'U')	
than otherwise would be required.@#%^&*('required', 'put', 'U')	
And the state's delegation is fearful@#%^&*('fearful', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the new funding will be counted against a separate $185 million in federal highway funds@#%^&*('counted', 'fearful', 'U')	
it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year.@#%^&*('expect', '$', 'U')	
Also, the high price of San Francisco real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations@#%^&*('puts', 'ROOT', 'R')	('state', 'attuned', 'U')	
more attuned to the national average.@#%^&*('attuned', 'puts', 'U')	
For example, disaster loans,@#%^&*('example', 'offer', 'U')	('loans', 'go', 'U')	('loans', 'offer', 'U')	
which will go to small businesses and homeowners,@#%^&*('go', 'loans', 'U')	
offer credit as low as 4% in some cases.@#%^&*('offer', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the San Francisco delegation finds itself asking@#%^&*('finds', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the cap per household be lifted to $500,000 from $100,000@#%^&*('cap', 'assist', 'U')	('lifted', 'asking', 'U')	('to', 'assist', 'U')	
to assist the hard hit but often wealthy Marina district.@#%^&*('assist', 'lifted', 'U')	
The Senate is expected to make some modifications today,@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but both the White House and Congress appear most anxious to speed final approval before tonight's deadline.@#%^&*('appear', 'expected', 'U')	
Administration pressure discourages any effort@#%^&*('discourages', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to add to total funding,@#%^&*('add', 'effort', 'U')	
and the Senate changes are expected to be largely technical@#%^&*('expected', 'discourages', 'U')	
-- dealing with highway aid@#%^&*('dealing', 'technical', 'U')	('dealing', 'technical', 'U')	
and lifting the ceiling on total Small Business Administration loans to $1.8 billion@#%^&*('lifting', 'technical', 'U')	('lifting', 'technical', 'U')	('lifting', 'dealing', 'U')	('to', 'accommodate', 'U')	
to accommodate the increased activity expected.@#%^&*('accommodate', 'lifting', 'U')	
Yesterday's floor action came@#%^&*('came', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as a House-Senate conference approved a nearly $8.5 billion fiscal 1990 military construction bill,@#%^&*('approved', 'came', 'U')	
representing a 5% reduction from last year@#%^&*('representing', 'bill', 'U')	
and making severe cuts from Pentagon requests for installations abroad.@#%^&*('making', 'bill', 'U')	('making', 'representing', 'U')	
An estimated $25.8 million is allocated@#%^&*('$', 'continue', 'U')	('allocated', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to continue work in Oman.@#%^&*('continue', 'allocated', 'U')	
But all funding is cut for the Philippines,@#%^&*('cut', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and projects in South Korea are cut to $13.6 million, or less than a sixth of the administration's request.@#%^&*
Closer to home, the negotiators were more generous.@#%^&*('generous', 'ROOT', 'R')	
An estimated $38.9 million was set aside for military installations in the home state of North Carolina Rep. W.G. Hefner, the House chairman.@#%^&*('set', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And $70.2 million would go to projects in Tennessee@#%^&*('go', 'ROOT', 'R')	
represented by his Senate counterpart and fellow Democrat, Sen. James Sasser.@#%^&*('represented', 'Tennessee', 'U')	
Texas and California are traditionally powerful within the conference,@#%^&*('Texas', 'striking', 'U')	('powerful', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but equally striking is the dominance of Alaska, Pennsylvania and West Virginia@#%^&*('striking', 'powerful', 'U')	
because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process.@#%^&*('power', 'dominance', 'U')	('elsewhere', 'dominance', 'U')	('process', 'dominance', 'U')	
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd@#%^&*('Byrd', 'added', 'U')	
(D., W.Va.)@#%^&*('D.', 'Byrd', 'U')	
even added report language@#%^&*('added', 'ROOT', 'R')	
listing $49.4 million in projects@#%^&*('listing', 'added', 'U')	
he wants in the budget next year.@#%^&*('wants', '$', 'U')	
No individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than Sen. Daniel Inouye@#%^&*('illustrated', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Inouye', 'chairs', 'U')	
(D., Hawaii),@#%^&*('D.', 'Inouye', 'U')	
who chairs the Senate defense subcommittee.@#%^&*('chairs', 'Inouye', 'U')	
In the final trading, the House was insistent on setting aside $500 million@#%^&*('insistent', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to carry out base closings@#%^&*('carry', 'setting', 'U')	
ordered to begin in fiscal 1990.@#%^&*('ordered', 'closings', 'U')	
But it gave ground to Mr. Inouye on a number of projects,@#%^&*('gave', 'ROOT', 'R')	
ranging from a $11 million parking garage here,@#%^&*('ranging', 'Inouye', 'U')	('a', 'transfer', 'U')	
to a land transfer in Hawaii,@#%^&*('transfer', 'gave', 'U')	('a', 'provision', 'U')	
to a provision@#%^&*('provision', 'gave', 'U')	('to', 'assist', 'U')	
to assist the Makwah Indian Tribe in Washington state.@#%^&*('assist', 'provision', 'U')	
The tribe is one of the poorest in the Pacific Northwest.@#%^&*('one', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Inouye,@#%^&*('Inouye', 'chairs', 'U')	('Inouye', 'used', 'U')	
who chairs the select committee on Indian Affairs,@#%^&*('chairs', 'Inouye', 'U')	
used his power@#%^&*('used', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to move $400,000 from the Air Force to the Bureau of Indian Affairs@#%^&*('move', 'power', 'U')	('to', 'assist', 'U')	
to assist in renovating a decommissoned base@#%^&*('assist', 'move', 'U')	('to', 'accommodate', 'U')	
to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center.@#%^&*('accommodate', 'renovating', 'U')	
Meanwhile, House-Senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $3.18 billion anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative,@#%^&*('agreed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
cutting other federal spending 0.43%@#%^&*('cutting', 'agreed', 'U')	
to pay for it.@#%^&*('pay', 'cutting', 'U')	
A formal House-Senate conference is expected to ratify the accord later this week.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')

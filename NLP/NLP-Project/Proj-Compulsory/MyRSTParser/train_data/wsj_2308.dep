Ripples from the strike by 55,000 Machinists union members against Boeing Co. reached air carriers Friday@#%^&*('Ripples', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as America West Airlines announced@#%^&*('announced', 'reached', 'U')	
it will postpone its new service out of Houston@#%^&*('postpone', 'announced', 'U')	('Houston', 'Ripples', 'U')	
because of delays@#%^&*('delays', 'Ripples', 'U')	
in receiving aircraft from the Seattle jet maker.@#%^&*('receiving', 'Ripples', 'U')	
Peter Otradovec, vice president for planning at the Phoenix, Ariz., carrier, said in an interview@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the work stoppage at Boeing,@#%^&*('that', 'caused', 'U')	('stoppage', 'caused', 'U')	
now entering its 13th day,@#%^&*('entering', 'Boeing', 'U')	
"has caused some turmoil in our scheduling"@#%^&*('caused', 'said', 'U')	
and that more than 500 passengers@#%^&*('that', 'put', 'U')	('passengers', 'booked', 'U')	('passengers', 'fly', 'U')	('passengers', 'put', 'U')	
who were booked@#%^&*('booked', 'passengers', 'U')	
to fly out of Houston on America West@#%^&*('fly', 'booked', 'U')	
would now be put on other airlines.@#%^&*('put', 'said', 'U')	('put', 'caused', 'U')	
Mr. Otradovec said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Boeing told America West@#%^&*('told', 'said', 'U')	
that the 757@#%^&*('that', 'delivered', 'U')	('757', 'delivered', 'U')	
it was supposed to get this Thursday@#%^&*('supposed', '757', 'U')	
wouldn't be delivered until Nov. 7@#%^&*('delivered', 'told', 'U')	
-- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights,@#%^&*('day', 'delivered', 'U')	('day', 'delivered', 'U')	
including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas.@#%^&*('nonstops', 'flights', 'U')	('nonstop', 'flights', 'U')	
Now, those routes aren't expected to begin until Jan.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Boeing is also supposed to send to America West another 757 twin-engine aircraft as well as a 737 by year's end.@#%^&*('supposed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Those, too, are almost certain to arrive late.@#%^&*('certain', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At this point, no other America West flights@#%^&*('point', 'affected', 'U')	('flights', 'affected', 'U')	
-- including its new service at San Antonio, Texas; Newark, N.J.; and Palmdale, Calif. --@#%^&*('service', 'flights', 'U')	
have been affected by the delays in Boeing deliveries.@#%^&*('affected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Nevertheless, the company's reaction underscores the domino effect@#%^&*('underscores', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that a huge manufacturer such as Boeing can have on other parts of the economy.@#%^&*('have', 'underscores', 'U')	
It also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company.@#%^&*('sure', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"I just don't feel@#%^&*('I', 'want', 'U')	('feel', 'said', 'U')	
that the company can really stand@#%^&*('stand', 'feel', 'U')	
or would want a prolonged walkout,"@#%^&*('want', 'feel', 'U')	('want', 'said', 'U')	
Tom Baker, president of Machinists' District 751, said in an interview yesterday.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"I don't think@#%^&*('think', 'ROOT', 'R')	
their customers would like it very much."@#%^&*('like', 'think', 'U')	
America West, though, is a smaller airline@#%^&*('West', 'affected', 'U')	('airline', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane@#%^&*('affected', 'airline', 'U')	
than many of its competitors would be.@#%^&*('be', 'airline', 'U')	
"I figure@#%^&*('figure', 'miss', 'U')	
that American and United probably have such a hard time@#%^&*('have', 'figure', 'U')	
counting all the planes in their fleets,@#%^&*('counting', 'time', 'U')	
they might not miss one at all,"@#%^&*('miss', 'said', 'U')	
Mr. Otradovec said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Indeed, a random check Friday didn't seem to indicate@#%^&*('seem', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations.@#%^&*('having', 'indicate', 'U')	
Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300@#%^&*('Airlines', 'set', 'U')	('Airlines', 'expects', 'U')	('Airlines', 'have', 'U')	('has', 'set', 'U')	('Boeing', 'set', 'U')

A spokesman for AMR Corp. said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Boeing has assured American Airlines@#%^&*('assured', 'said', 'U')	
it will deliver a 757 on time later this month.@#%^&*('deliver', 'Airlines', 'U')	
American is preparing to take delivery of another 757 in early December and 20 more next year@#%^&*('American', 'anticipating', 'U')	('preparing', 'ROOT', 'R')	('is', 'anticipating', 'U')	
and isn't anticipating any changes in that timetable.@#%^&*('anticipating', 'preparing', 'U')	
In Seattle, a Boeing spokesman explained@#%^&*('explained', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers@#%^&*('been', 'explained', 'U')	('that', 'impossible', 'U')	('it', 'impossible', 'U')	('it', 'predict', 'U')	
and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike.@#%^&*('impossible', 'explained', 'U')	('impossible', 'been', 'U')	
Meanwhile, supervisors and non-striking employees have been trying to finish some 40 aircraft@#%^&*('trying', 'ROOT', 'R')	('aircraft', 'completed', 'U')	
-- mostly 747 and 767 jumbo jets at the company's Everett, Wash., plant --@#%^&*('jets', 'aircraft', 'U')	
that were all but completed before the walkout.@#%^&*('completed', 'aircraft', 'U')	
As of Friday, four had been delivered@#%^&*('delivered', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'plane', 'U')	
and a fifth plane, a 747-400, was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to Air China.@#%^&*('supposed', 'delivered', 'U')	
No date has yet been set@#%^&*('date', 'get', 'U')	('set', 'ROOT', 'R')

"We want to make sure@#%^&*('want', 'said', 'U')	
they know@#%^&*('know', 'sure', 'U')	
what they want@#%^&*('want', 'know', 'U')

said Doug Hammond, the federal mediator@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	('mediator', 'been', 'U')	
who has been in contact with both sides@#%^&*('been', 'mediator', 'U')	
since the strike began.@#%^&*('began', 'been', 'U')	
The investment community, for one, has been anticipating a speedy resolution.@#%^&*('anticipating', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Though Boeing's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday,@#%^&*('battered', 'risen', 'U')	('it', 'risen', 'U')	
it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders.@#%^&*('risen', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"The market has taken two views:@#%^&*('taken', 'said', 'U')	
that the labor situation will get settled in the short term@#%^&*('settled', 'taken', 'U')	('settled', 'taken', 'U')	('that', 'look', 'U')	
and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term,"@#%^&*('look', 'taken', 'U')	('look', 'taken', 'U')	('look', 'settled', 'U')	
said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Boeing's shares fell $4 Friday@#%^&*('fell', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to close at $57.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.@#%^&*('close', 'fell', 'U')	
But Mr. Baker said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
he thinks@#%^&*('thinks', 'said', 'U')	
the earliest@#%^&*('earliest', 'end', 'U')	('a', 'pact', 'U')	
a pact could be struck@#%^&*('struck', 'earliest', 'U')

hinting@#%^&*('hinting', 'end', 'U')	
that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week.@#%^&*('resume', 'hinting', 'U')	
Still,@#%^&*('Still', 'possible', 'U')	
he said,@#%^&*('said', 'possible', 'U')	
it's possible that the strike could last considerably longer.@#%^&*('possible', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"I wouldn't expect an immediate resolution to anything."@#%^&*('expect', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Last week, Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz sent striking workers a letter,@#%^&*('sent', 'ROOT', 'R')	
saying@#%^&*('saying', 'sent', 'U')	
that "to my knowledge, Boeing's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major U.S. industrial firm in recent history."@#%^&*('represents', 'saying', 'U')	
But Mr. Baker called the letter@#%^&*('called', 'ROOT', 'R')	('letter', 'weak', 'U')	
-- and the company's offer of a 10% wage increase over the life of the pact, plus bonuses --@#%^&*('offer', 'letter', 'U')	
"very weak."@#%^&*('weak', 'called', 'U')	
He added@#%^&*('added', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the company miscalculated the union's resolve and the workers' disgust@#%^&*('miscalculated', 'added', 'U')	
with being forced to work many hours overtime.@#%^&*('forced', 'miscalculated', 'U')	
In separate developments:@#%^&*('developments', 'broken', 'U')

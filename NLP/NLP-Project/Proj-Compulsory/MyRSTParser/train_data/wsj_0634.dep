Dentsu Inc., the world's largest advertising agency on the strength of its dominance in the Japanese market, is setting its sights on overseas expansion.@#%^&*('setting', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Last year, Dentsu started HDM, a joint network with U.S. ad agency Young & Rubicam and Eurocom of France.@#%^&*('started', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A few months ago, Dentsu acquired 69% of Australian agency Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd. for 5.9 million Australian dollars@#%^&*('acquired', 'ROOT', 'R')	
(US$4.6 million).@#%^&*('US$', 'dollars', 'U')	
Dentsu has U.S. subsidiaries,@#%^&*('has', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but they keep low profiles.@#%^&*('keep', 'has', 'U')	
Now, the giant marketing company,@#%^&*('Now', 'considering', 'U')	('company', 'holds', 'U')	('company', 'considering', 'U')	
which holds 25% of Japan's 4.4 trillion yen@#%^&*('holds', 'company', 'U')	('Japan', 'industry', 'U')	('yen', 'industry', 'U')	
($30.96 billion)@#%^&*('$', 'yen', 'U')	
advertising industry,@#%^&*('industry', '%', 'U')	('is', 'considering', 'U')	
is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the U.S. or Europe.@#%^&*('considering', 'ROOT', 'R')	
What is driving Dentsu's international expansion largely is the need@#%^&*('need', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to keep up with its Japanese clients@#%^&*('keep', 'need', 'U')	
as they grow in the U.S. and Europe.@#%^&*('grow', 'keep', 'U')	
"If we don't do something . . .@#%^&*('do', 'ROOT', 'R')	
we won't be able to catch up with demand,"@#%^&*('able', 'says', 'U')	
says a Dentsu spokesman.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Our president said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
acquisition is an effective method."@#%^&*('method', 'said', 'U')	
Last year, Dentsu's foreign business accounted for less than 10% of total billings,@#%^&*('accounted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but the company is aiming at 20% in the near future.@#%^&*('aiming', 'accounted', 'U')	
So far, it appears cautious about taking the big step.@#%^&*('appears', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For example, the spokesman says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Dentsu has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled British marketing group Saatchi & Saatchi PLC.@#%^&*('approached', 'says', 'U')	
But he said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Dentsu hasn't looked seriously at Saatchi.@#%^&*('looked', 'said', 'U')	
Though Dentsu says@#%^&*('says', 'laying', 'U')	
it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines,@#%^&*('has', 'says', 'U')	('it', 'laying', 'U')	('is', 'laying', 'U')	
it is laying the groundwork for international growth.@#%^&*('laying', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets@#%^&*('setting', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and training workers to do business abroad.@#%^&*('workers', 'charge', 'U')	('workers', 'markets', 'U')	('do', 'setting', 'U')	
For the year@#%^&*('year', 'rose', 'U')	
ended March 31,@#%^&*('ended', 'year', 'U')	
Dentsu sales rose 19% to $8.9 billion from $7.5 billion,@#%^&*('rose', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and net income jumped 59% to $102 million from $64 million.@#%^&*('jumped', 'rose', 'U')	
Dentsu's billings last year were larger than those of Young & Rubicam, the world's second-largest ad agency,@#%^&*('larger', 'ROOT', 'R')	
according to a survey by the publication Advertising Age.@#%^&*('to', 'larger', 'U')	('survey', 'larger', 'U')	
But success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as manufacturers.@#%^&*('trickier', 'ROOT', 'R')	
On its own, Dentsu's muscle in Japan may count for little in major foreign markets@#%^&*('count', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when seeking non-Japanese clients.@#%^&*('seeking', 'count', 'U')	
Thus, an acquisition may prove the necessary course.@#%^&*('prove', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But Japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad@#%^&*('cautious', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because client relationships are different.@#%^&*('different', 'expanding', 'U')	
Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry, a practice@#%^&*('do', 'says', 'U')	('practice', 'unacceptable', 'U')	
"that would be unacceptable by traditional Western conflict rules,"@#%^&*('unacceptable', 'practice', 'U')	
says Roy Warman, the London chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi's communications division.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Although acquiring a foreign company would expand Japanese advertising agencies' business to foreign clients,@#%^&*('expand', 'companies', 'U')	
many clients would also be Japanese companies@#%^&*('companies', 'says', 'U')	
expanding overseas,@#%^&*('expanding', 'companies', 'U')	
says the Dentsu spokesman.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the different business system would make it hard for Dentsu to provide these Japanese companies the same kind of services@#%^&*('make', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they do in Japan.@#%^&*('do', 'services', 'U')

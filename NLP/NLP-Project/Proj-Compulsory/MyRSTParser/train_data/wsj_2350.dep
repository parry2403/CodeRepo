Time magazine, in a move@#%^&*('magazine', 'lowering', 'U')	('magazine', 'increasing', 'U')	('magazine', 'cutting', 'U')	
to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers,@#%^&*('reduce', 'move', 'U')	
is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year,@#%^&*('lowering', 'ROOT', 'R')	
increasing its subscription rates@#%^&*('increasing', 'lowering', 'U')	
and cutting back on merchandise giveaways.@#%^&*('cutting', 'lowering', 'U')	
In an announcement to its staff last week, executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Time', 'de', 'U')	
Time will "dramatically de-emphasize" its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives;@#%^&*('de', 'said', 'U')	
cut the circulation@#%^&*('cut', 'de', 'U')	
it guarantees advertisers@#%^&*('guarantees', 'circulation', 'U')	
by 300,000, to four million;@#%^&*('300', 'guarantees', 'U')	('million', 'guarantees', 'U')	
and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $4 to $55.@#%^&*('increase', 'de', 'U')	('increase', 'cut', 'U')	
In a related development, the news-weekly, for the fourth year in a row, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it won't increase its advertising rates in 1990;@#%^&*('increase', 'said', 'U')	('a', 'page', 'U')	
a full, four-color page in the magazine costs about $120,000.@#%^&*('costs', 'said', 'U')	
However,@#%^&*('However', 'be', 'U')	
because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered,@#%^&*
ad rates will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber,@#%^&*('be', 'ROOT', 'R')	
according to Richard Heinemann, Time associate publisher.@#%^&*('to', 'be', 'U')	('Heinemann', 'be', 'U')	
Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines@#%^&*('following', 'ROOT', 'R')	('course', 'challenged', 'U')	
that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth@#%^&*('challenged', 'course', 'U')	('that', 'way', 'U')	
that maintaining artificially high, and expensive, circulations is the way@#%^&*('way', 'challenged', 'U')	
to draw advertisers.@#%^&*('draw', 'way', 'U')	
In recent years, Reader's Digest, New York Times Co. 's McCall's, and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide, have cut their massive circulation rate bases@#%^&*('cut', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to eliminate marginal circulation@#%^&*('eliminate', 'bases', 'U')	
and hold down rates for advertisers.@#%^&*('hold', 'bases', 'U')	('hold', 'eliminate', 'U')	
Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms@#%^&*('become', 'ROOT', 'R')	
of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies.@#%^&*('attracting', 'forms', 'U')	
But Time, as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner, wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks.@#%^&*('wants', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Besides, Time executives think@#%^&*('think', 'ROOT', 'R')	
selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky.@#%^&*('tacky', 'think', 'U')	
"Giveaways just give people the wrong image,"@#%^&*('give', 'said', 'U')	
said Mr. Heinemann.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"That perception takes the focus off the magazine."@#%^&*('takes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers.@#%^&*('paint', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"What we are doing is screening out the readers@#%^&*('screening', 'said', 'U')	('readers', 'related', 'U')	('are', 'related', 'U')	
who are only casually related to the magazine@#%^&*('related', 'readers', 'U')	
and don't really read it,"@#%^&*('read', 'screening', 'U')	('read', 'said', 'U')	
said Mr. Heinemann.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"We are trying to create quality and involvement."@#%^&*('trying', 'ROOT', 'R')	
However, Time executives used the same explanation@#%^&*('used', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when in October 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4.6 million to 4.3 million.@#%^&*('cut', 'used', 'U')	
And Time's paid circulation,@#%^&*('paid', 'ROOT', 'R')	('circulation', 'dropped', 'U')	
according to Audit Bureau of Circulations,@#%^&*('to', 'dropped', 'U')	('Bureau', 'dropped', 'U')	
dropped 7.3% to 4,393,237 in the six months@#%^&*('dropped', 'paid', 'U')	
ended June 30, 1989.@#%^&*('ended', 'months', 'U')	
Still, Time's move is being received well, once again.@#%^&*('received', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"It's terrific for advertisers to know@#%^&*('terrific', 'said', 'U')	
the reader will be paying more,"@#%^&*('paying', 'know', 'U')	
said Michael Drexler, national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"A few drops in circulation are of no consequence.@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It's not a show of weakness;@#%^&*('show', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they are improving the quality of circulation@#%^&*('improving', 'show', 'U')	
while insuring their profits."@#%^&*('insuring', 'improving', 'U')	
Mr. Heinemann said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry:@#%^&*('represent', 'said', 'U')	('magazine', 'revenue', 'U')	
a magazine's net revenue per subscriber, or the actual revenue from subscribers@#%^&*('revenue', 'represent', 'U')	('revenue', 'focus', 'U')	('revenue', 'represent', 'U')	('revenue', 'focus', 'U')	
after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away.@#%^&*('stripped', 'represent', 'U')	
"The question is how much are we getting from each reader,"@#%^&*('is', 'said', 'U')	
said Mr. Heinemann.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Time's rivals news-weeklies, Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report, are less reliant on electronic giveaways,@#%^&*('reliant', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases.@#%^&*('increasing', 'reliant', 'U')	
Both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')

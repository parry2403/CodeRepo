The government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions, in its first wave of sales of big, sick thrifts,@#%^&*('sold', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth.@#%^&*('prevented', 'sold', 'U')	
The four S&Ls were sold to large banks,@#%^&*('sold', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as was the case with most of the 28 previous transactions@#%^&*('case', 'sold', 'U')	
initiated by the Resolution Trust Corp.@#%^&*('initiated', 'transactions', 'U')	
since it was created in the S&L bailout legislation two months ago.@#%^&*('created', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C.,@#%^&*('sold', 'ROOT', 'R')	('N.C.', 'expanded', 'U')	
which has aggressively expanded its markets, particularly in Texas and Florida.@#%^&*('expanded', 'N.C.', 'U')	
A Canadian bank bought another thrift, in the first RTC transaction with a foreign bank.@#%^&*('bought', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Under these deals, the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets.@#%^&*('sells', 'ROOT', 'R')	
These "clean-bank" transactions leave the bulk of bad assets, mostly real estate, with the government,@#%^&*('leave', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to be sold later.@#%^&*('sold', 'leave', 'U')	
In these four, for instance, the RTC is stuck with $4.51 billion in bad assets.@#%^&*('stuck', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Acquirers paid premiums@#%^&*('paid', 'ROOT', 'R')	
ranging from 1.5% to 3.7% for the deposits and branch systems, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting.@#%^&*('ranging', 'premiums', 'U')	
The buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks,@#%^&*('locked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as has been the case with previous deals.@#%^&*('case', 'locked', 'U')	
After that, the buyers may repudiate the rates@#%^&*('repudiate', 'ROOT', 'R')	
paid by the former thrifts.@#%^&*('paid', 'rates', 'U')	
But it's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps.@#%^&*('uncertain', 'ROOT', 'R')	
NCNB, for example, has been one of the highest rate payers in the Texas market,@#%^&*('one', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and in Florida, rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities.@#%^&*('sensitive', 'one', 'U')	
The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales@#%^&*('targeted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines,@#%^&*('spend', 'targeted', 'U')	
but the delays illustrate the tough chore@#%^&*('illustrate', 'targeted', 'U')	
facing the agency.@#%^&*('facing', 'chore', 'U')	
"These thrifts are beached whales,"@#%^&*('beached', 'said', 'U')	
said Bert Ely, an industry consultant@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
based in Alexandria, Va.@#%^&*('based', 'consultant', 'U')	
For example, the delay@#%^&*('example', 'forced', 'U')	('delay', 'Kan.', 'U')	
in selling People's Heritage Savings, Salina, Kan., with $1.7 billion in assets,@#%^&*('People', 'delay', 'U')	('Kan.', 'forced', 'U')	
has forced the RTC to consider selling off the thrift branch-by-branch, instead of as a whole institution.@#%^&*('forced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
NCNB continued its foray into the Florida and Texas markets.@#%^&*('continued', 'ROOT', 'R')	
NCNB will acquire University Federal Savings Association, Houston,@#%^&*('acquire', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Association', 'had', 'U')	
which had assets of $2.8 billion.@#%^&*('had', 'Association', 'U')	
NCNB Texas National Bank will pay the RTC a premium of $129 million for $3.5 billion in deposits.@#%^&*('pay', 'ROOT', 'R')	
As a measure of the depths@#%^&*('measure', 'pay', 'U')	('depths', 'sunk', 'U')	('the', 'market', 'U')	
to which the Texas real estate market has sunk,@#%^&*('sunk', 'depths', 'U')	('the', 'RTC', 'U')	
the RTC will pay $3.8 billion to NCNB@#%^&*('pay', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'take', 'U')	
to take $750 million of bad assets.@#%^&*('take', 'pay', 'U')	
NCNB also acquired Freedom Savings & Loan Association, Tampa, Fla.,@#%^&*('acquired', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Savings', 'had', 'U')	('Association', 'had', 'U')	
which had total assets of $900 million.@#%^&*('had', 'Savings', 'U')	
NCNB will pay the RTC a premium of $40.4 million for $1.1 billion in deposits.@#%^&*('pay', 'ROOT', 'R')	
NCNB will also acquire $266 million of Freedom's assets from the RTC,@#%^&*('acquire', 'ROOT', 'R')	('RTC', 'require', 'U')	('will', 'require', 'U')	
which will require $875 million in assistance.@#%^&*('require', 'RTC', 'U')	
Meridian Bancorp Inc., Reading, Pa., will acquire Hill Financial Savings Association, Red Hill, Pa.,@#%^&*('acquire', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Association', 'had', 'U')	
which had $2.3 billion in assets.@#%^&*('had', 'Association', 'U')	
Meridian will pay a premium of $30.5 million@#%^&*('pay', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to assume $2 billion in deposits.@#%^&*('assume', 'pay', 'U')	
It will also purchase $845 million of the thrift's assets, with $1.9 billion in RTC assistance.@#%^&*('purchase', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In the first RTC transaction with a foreign buyer, Royal Trustco Ltd., Toronto, will acquire Pacific Savings Bank, Costa Mesa, Calif.,@#%^&*('acquire', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Bank', 'had', 'U')	
which had $949 million in assets.@#%^&*('had', 'Bank', 'U')	
Royal Trustco will pay the RTC $25 million@#%^&*('pay', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to assume $989 million in deposits.@#%^&*('assume', 'pay', 'U')	
It will also purchase $473 million in assets,@#%^&*('It', 'receive', 'U')	('purchase', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and receive $550 million in assistance from the RTC.@#%^&*('receive', 'purchase', 'U')

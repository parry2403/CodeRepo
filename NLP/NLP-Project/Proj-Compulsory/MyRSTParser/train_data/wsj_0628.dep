Factory owners are buying new machinery at a good rate this fall,@#%^&*('buying', 'ROOT', 'R')	('machine', 'makers', 'U')	
machine tool makers say,@#%^&*('say', 'buying', 'U')	
but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks raise questions about fourth-quarter demand from the important automotive industry.@#%^&*('raise', 'buying', 'U')	
September orders for machine tools rebounded from the summer doldrums,@#%^&*('orders', 'remained', 'U')	('rebounded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but remained 7.7% below year-earlier levels,@#%^&*('remained', 'rebounded', 'U')	
according to figures from NMTBA@#%^&*('to', 'remained', 'U')	('figures', 'remained', 'U')	
-- the Association for Manufacturing Technology.@#%^&*('Association', 'remained', 'U')	
Domestic machine tool plants received $303 million of orders last month, up 33% from August's $227.1 million, but still below the $328.2 million of September 1988,@#%^&*('received', 'said', 'U')	
NMTBA said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Machine tools are complex machines@#%^&*('machines', 'ROOT', 'R')	
ranging from lathes to metal-forming presses@#%^&*('ranging', 'machines', 'U')	('presses', 'used', 'U')	('presses', 'shape', 'U')

"Overall demand still is very respectable,"@#%^&*('respectable', 'says', 'U')	
says Christopher C. Cole, group vice president at Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the nation's largest machine tool producer.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"The outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term."@#%^&*('positive', 'ROOT', 'R')	
September orders for all U.S. producers, in fact, were slightly above the monthly average for 1988, a good year for the industry.@#%^&*('were', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Aerospace orders are very good,"@#%^&*('good', 'says', 'U')	
Mr. Cole says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"And export business is still good.@#%^&*('good', 'ROOT', 'R')

they haven't been canceled."@#%^&*('canceled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"September was one of the biggest order months in our history,"@#%^&*('one', 'says', 'U')

plan to spend more on factory equipment in 1990 than in 1989.@#%^&*('plan', 'say', 'U')	
But sales of North American-made 1990-model cars are running at an annual rate of only six million, down from 7.1 million a year earlier.@#%^&*('running', 'ROOT', 'R')

Machine tool executives are hopeful, however,@#%^&*('hopeful', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that recent developments in Eastern Europe will expand markets for U.S.-made machine tools in that region.@#%^&*('expand', 'hopeful', 'U')	
There is demand for state-of-the-art machine tools in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	('as', 'strive', 'U')	
as those nations strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods.@#%^&*('strive', 'is', 'U')	
However, there's a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and the Defense Department over whether sophisticated U.S. machine tools would increase the Soviet Union's military might.@#%^&*("'s", 'ROOT', 'R')	
"The Commerce Department says@#%^&*('says', 'complains', 'U')

If that controversy continues,@#%^&*('continues', 'say', 'U')	
U.S. machine tool makers say,@#%^&*('makers', 'German', 'U')	('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
West German and other foreign producers are likely to grab most of the sales in Eastern Europe.@#%^&*('German', 'say', 'U')	('likely', 'say', 'U')

Orders last month for metal-forming presses and other machinery@#%^&*('Orders', 'surged', 'U')	('machinery', 'surged', 'U')

surged to $110.1 million, a 78% rise from $61.7 million a year earlier and a 55% gain from $70.9 million in August.@#%^&*('surged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Today's presses are large and costly machines,@#%^&*('machines', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'orders', 'U')	
and a few orders can produce a high total for one month@#%^&*('produce', 'machines', 'U')	('month', 'indicate', 'U')

Machine tool shipments last month were $281.2 million, a 24% rise from a year earlier and a 25% increase from August.@#%^&*('$', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Shipments have run well ahead of 1988 all year,@#%^&*('run', 'ROOT', 'R')

U.S. producers had a $2.15 billion backlog of unfilled orders at the end of September.@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')

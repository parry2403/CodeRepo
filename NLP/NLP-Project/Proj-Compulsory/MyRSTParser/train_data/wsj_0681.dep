Bam!@#%^&*('Bam', 'Wham', 'U')	
Twice in two weeks the unraveling of the on-again, off-again UAL buy-out slammed the stock market.@#%^&*('Twice', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Now, stock prices seem to be in a general retreat.@#%^&*('seem', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Since peaking at 2791.41 on Oct. 9,@#%^&*('peaking', 'lost', 'U')	
the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 194.69 points, or 7%,@#%^&*('lost', 'ROOT', 'R')

falling on the New York Stock Exchange each day@#%^&*('falling', 'issues', 'U')

And the number of stocks@#%^&*('And', 'outstrips', 'U')	('number', 'outstrips', 'U')

But why should an iffy $6.79 billion leveraged buy-out deal shake the foundations of the entire stock market?@#%^&*('shake', 'vary', 'U')	
Opinions vary@#%^&*('vary', 'ROOT', 'R')	
about how important the UAL deal was to the market's health,@#%^&*('was', 'vary', 'U')

that the market gyrations@#%^&*('that', 'created', 'U')	('gyrations', 'created', 'U')

"If this had happened a few months ago@#%^&*

says Dennis Jarrett, a market strategist at Kidder Peabody.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
There are, of course, analysts@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	('analysts', 'view', 'U')	
who view the near-panic@#%^&*('view', 'analysts', 'U')	('near', 'swept', 'U')	
that briefly swept through investors on Oct. 13 and again on Oct. 24@#%^&*('swept', 'near', 'U')	
as momentary lapses of good judgment@#%^&*('lapses', 'swept', 'U')	('lapses', 'undermined', 'U')	
that have only temporarily undermined a healthy stock market.@#%^&*('undermined', 'lapses', 'U')	
Sure, price action is volatile@#%^&*('volatile', 'ROOT', 'R')

but all-in-all stocks are still a good place to be,@#%^&*('place', 'volatile', 'U')

The reaction to the UAL debacle "is mindless,"@#%^&*('mindless', 'says', 'U')	
says John Connolly, chief market strategist at Dean Witter.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"UAL is a small deal@#%^&*('deal', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as far as the overall market is concerned.@#%^&*('far', 'deal', 'U')

you can make it a big deal@#%^&*('make', 'is', 'U')	('deal', 'is', 'U')	('deal', 'draw', 'U')	
is to draw linkages@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	('linkages', 'make', 'U')	
that just don't make sense."@#%^&*('make', 'linkages', 'U')	
He suggests, for example,@#%^&*('suggests', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that investors may have assumed@#%^&*('assumed', 'suggests', 'U')	('that', 'get', 'U')	
that@#%^&*('just', 'get', 'U')	
just because UAL couldn't get financing,@#%^&*
no leveraged buy-outs can get financing.@#%^&*('get', 'assumed', 'U')	
Carried even further,@#%^&*('Carried', 'assumed', 'U')	
some investors assumed@#%^&*('assumed', 'ROOT', 'R')

since leveraged buy-outs are the only thing@#%^&*('thing', 'collapse', 'U')	
propping up stock prices,@#%^&*('propping', 'thing', 'U')	
the market would collapse@#%^&*('collapse', 'assumed', 'U')	
if no more LBOs could be done.@#%^&*('done', 'collapse', 'U')	
"There will still be deals,"@#%^&*('deals', 'argues', 'U')	
argues Mr. Connolly.@#%^&*('argues', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"There may not be as many@#%^&*('many', 'ROOT', 'R')

He forecasts@#%^&*('forecasts', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the emphasis in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he calls "strategic deals,@#%^&*('return', 'forecasts', 'U')	('deals', 'taking', 'U')	
in which somebody is taking over a company@#%^&*('taking', 'deals', 'U')

even without deals,@#%^&*('even', 'figures', 'U')	('deals', 'figures', 'U')	
Mr. Connolly figures@#%^&*('figures', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the market would remain healthy.@#%^&*('remain', 'figures', 'U')	
He notes, for instance,@#%^&*('notes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that there hasn't been a merger or acquisition among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1986,@#%^&*('merger', 'notes', 'U')	('acquisition', 'notes', 'U')	('that', 'average', 'U')	
yet that average only three weeks ago hit a record high.@#%^&*('hit', 'notes', 'U')	
"Those stocks are up@#%^&*('are', 'says', 'U')	
because their earnings are up@#%^&*('their', 'dividends', 'U')	
and their dividends are up,"@#%^&*('he', 'says', 'U')	
he says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Even the volatility@#%^&*('volatility', 'bad', 'U')	
created by stock index arbitrage and other computer-driven trading strategies@#%^&*('created', 'volatility', 'U')	
isn't entirely bad, in Mr. Connolly's view.@#%^&*('bad', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For the long-term investor@#%^&*('investor', 'picks', 'U')	('investor', 'provide', 'U')	
who picks stocks carefully,@#%^&*('picks', 'investor', 'U')	
the price volatility can provide welcome buying opportunities@#%^&*('provide', 'ROOT', 'R')

of surging to new highs anytime soon.@#%^&*('surging', 'sanguine', 'U')	
Her view is that stock prices have three major props:@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
merger and buy-out proposals, earnings and the economic outlook.@#%^&*('proposals', 'props', 'U')	('earnings', 'props', 'U')	('outlook', 'props', 'U')

But any chance@#%^&*('chance', 'lies', 'U')	
for prices to surge above fair value@#%^&*('prices', 'chance', 'U')	
lies in the speculation@#%^&*('lies', 'ROOT', 'R')	('speculation', 'accompanies', 'U')	
that accompanies a vigorous merger and buy-out business,@#%^&*('accompanies', 'speculation', 'U')	
and UAL has obviously put a damper on that.@#%^&*('put', 'lies', 'U')	
"Stocks aren't cheap anymore,@#%^&*('cheap', 'says', 'U')	('anymore', 'changes', 'U')

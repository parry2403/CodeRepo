The municipal bond market is bracing for tough times through the end of the year@#%^&*('bracing', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as it struggles to absorb an oversupply of bonds@#%^&*('struggles', 'bracing', 'U')	
and two of its best customers turn into sellers.@#%^&*('turn', 'bracing', 'U')	
Commercial banks and property/casualty insurers,@#%^&*('banks', 'own', 'U')	('banks', 'dumping', 'U')	('insurers', 'own', 'U')	('insurers', 'dumping', 'U')	
which together own about 36% of all municipal bonds,@#%^&*('own', 'banks', 'U')	
have been dumping their securities for weeks.@#%^&*('dumping', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Last week,@#%^&*('week', 'said', 'U')	
traders said,@#%^&*('said', 'were', 'U')	
there were three institutional sellers for every buyer.@#%^&*('were', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Every day we're getting new bid lists" from would-be sellers,@#%^&*('getting', 'said', 'U')	
one trader said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Most dealers cannot continue to absorb this supply."@#%^&*('continue', 'ROOT', 'R')	
As a result, yields on long-term muni bonds now stand at about 95% of long-term Treasury yields, the highest such level in more than two years.@#%^&*('stand', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"There is incredible negative psychology building in the market,"@#%^&*('is', 'said', 'U')	
said Donna Avedisian, a vice president at Merrill Lynch & Co.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"People are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers."@#%^&*('concerned', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The yield on a group of 25 revenue bonds@#%^&*('yield', 'exceeds', 'U')	
compiled by the Bond Buyer, a trade publication,@#%^&*('compiled', 'bonds', 'U')	
now exceeds 7.50%.@#%^&*('exceeds', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At this week's New York City bond sale, traders expect yields on the 20-year New York bonds to nearly match the 7.9% yield on 30-year Treasury bonds.@#%^&*('expect', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For an investor in the 28% federal tax bracket, 7.9% tax-free is the same as 10.38% on a taxable investment.@#%^&*('same', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That's a taxable-equivalent yield nearly three percentage points more than the current yield on 30-year Treasury bonds.@#%^&*('yield', 'ROOT', 'R')	
How quickly things change.@#%^&*('change', 'ROOT', 'R')	
This past summer, investors' appetite for municipal bonds seemed insatiable.@#%^&*('seemed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Individuals eager for tax-free income drove up bond prices,@#%^&*('drove', 'ROOT', 'R')	
making state and local government debt one of the best-performing types of fixed-income investments during the period.@#%^&*('making', 'drove', 'U')

institutional investors are rushing to dump their holdings.@#%^&*('rushing', 'way', 'U')	
Bond market analysts say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the institutional selling was triggered by several factors.@#%^&*('triggered', 'say', 'U')	
Big banks such as Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan,@#%^&*('banks', 'taking', 'U')	('banks', 'looking', 'U')	
which have been taking heavy charges@#%^&*('taking', 'banks', 'U')

"We don't need the shelter of tax-free bonds,"@#%^&*('need', 'said', 'U')	
said a spokeswoman at Chemical.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In recent weeks,@#%^&*('weeks', 'sold', 'U')	
traders said,@#%^&*('said', 'sold', 'U')	
Chemical has sold more than $1 billion of tax-free bonds.@#%^&*('sold', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The spokeswoman confirmed@#%^&*('confirmed', 'ROOT', 'R')

will be phased out.@#%^&*('phased', 'year', 'U')	
There is speculation that property/casualty firms will sell even more munis@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	('as', 'scramble', 'U')

related to Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake.@#%^&*('related', 'pay', 'U')	
Fundamental factors are at work as well.@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Muni bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue, at a time@#%^&*('worried', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs.@#%^&*('face', 'time', 'U')

that's driving the market,"@#%^&*('driving', 'factor', 'U')	
said Ronald Ian Heller, vice president at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc., a subsidiary of First Chicago Corp.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign.@#%^&*('considered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mutual funds, for example, are said to be selling existing municipal bonds@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'raise', 'U')

to buy new issues.@#%^&*('buy', 'raise', 'U')	
Because municipal bonds yields have risen at a time@#%^&*('risen', 'assuming', 'U')	
when interest rates generally have fallen,@#%^&*('fallen', 'time', 'U')

the market's tone could pick up this week@#%^&*('pick', 'said', 'U')	
if New York City's $787 million bond offering goes well.@#%^&*('goes', 'pick', 'U')	
The offering will include $729 million of 20-year tax-exempt bonds and $57.8 million of taxable bonds.@#%^&*('include', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A few weeks ago, New York sold $750 million of tax-exempts.@#%^&*('sold', 'ROOT', 'R')

On Friday, some issues fell nearly one point, or close to $10 for each $1,000 face amount.@#%^&*('fell', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The sell-off in New York City bonds was triggered by concerns about the city's financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election.@#%^&*('triggered', 'ROOT', 'R')

Credit market analysts expected the Treasury to cancel today's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $17 billion of cash management bills.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Instead, the Treasury announced@#%^&*('Treasury', 'said', 'U')	('announced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it would sell $2 billion of 51-day cash management bills today@#%^&*('sell', 'announced', 'U')

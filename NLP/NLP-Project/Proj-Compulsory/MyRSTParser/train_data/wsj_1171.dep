Benjamin Jacobson & Sons has been the New York Stock Exchange specialist firm in charge of trading stock in UAL Corp. and its predecessors since the early 1930s.@#%^&*('firm', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the firm has never had a day like yesterday.@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At first UAL didn't open@#%^&*('open', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because of an order imbalance.@#%^&*('imbalance', 'open', 'U')	
When it did a half-hour into the session,@#%^&*('did', 'priced', 'U')	('it', 'priced', 'U')	
it was priced at $150 a share, down more than $28 from Monday's close.@#%^&*('priced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It sank further to as low as $145,@#%^&*('sank', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'rally', 'U')	
but a big rally developed in the last half hour,@#%^&*('developed', 'sank', 'U')	
pushing the stock back up to close at $170, down just $8.375 from Monday.@#%^&*('pushing', 'developed', 'U')	
In the process, 4.9 million shares traded,@#%^&*('traded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
making UAL the second most active issue on the Big Board.@#%^&*('making', 'traded', 'U')	
Munching pizza@#%^&*('Munching', 'presided', 'U')	
when they could@#%^&*('could', 'Munching', 'U')	
and yelling@#%^&*('yelling', 'Munching', 'U')	('yelling', 'presided', 'U')	
until their voices gave out,@#%^&*('gave', 'yelling', 'U')	('the', 'specialists', 'U')	
the two Benjamin Jacobson specialists at the Big Board's UAL trading post yesterday presided over what can only be described as a financial free-for-all.@#%^&*('presided', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"It was chaotic.@#%^&*('chaotic', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But we like to call it 'controlled chaos, '"@#%^&*('like', 'said', 'U')	
said 47-year-old Robert J. Jacobson Jr., grandson of the firm's founder.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
He manned the UAL post yesterday with Christopher Bates, 33, an energetic Long Islander@#%^&*('manned', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Islander', 'ringer', 'U')	
who's a dead ringer for actor Nicolas Cage.@#%^&*('ringer', 'Islander', 'U')	
Who was doing all the selling?@#%^&*('doing', 'Options', 'U')	
"Options traders, arbitrage traders@#%^&*('Options', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- everyone,"@#%^&*('everyone', 'traders', 'U')	
said Mr. Bates,@#%^&*('said', 'everyone', 'U')	
cooling down with a carton of apple juice after the close yesterday.@#%^&*('cooling', 'everyone', 'U')	('close', 'Options', 'U')	('yesterday', 'Options', 'U')	
Added Mr. Jacobson,@#%^&*('Added', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"There were some pretty bad losses in the stock."@#%^&*('were', 'Added', 'U')	
Big Board traders said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'order', 'U')	
a 200,000-share buy order at $150 a share@#%^&*('order', 'active', 'U')	('order', 'is', 'U')	
entered by Bear, Stearns & Co.,@#%^&*('entered', '$', 'U')	
which was active in UAL stock all day,@#%^&*('active', 'order', 'U')	
is what set off the UAL crowd in the late afternoon.@#%^&*('is', 'said', 'U')	
A subsequent rally in UAL helped the staggering stock market stage an astonishing recovery from an 80-point deficit@#%^&*('helped', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'finish', 'U')	
to finish only slightly below Monday's close.@#%^&*('finish', 'stage', 'U')	
Both Jacobson traders,@#%^&*('traders', 'hoping', 'U')	('traders', 'read', 'U')	
who had been hoping@#%^&*('hoping', 'traders', 'U')	
UAL trading would get back to normal,@#%^&*('get', 'hoping', 'U')	
read the news about the unraveling of UAL takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning.@#%^&*('read', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The news told them@#%^&*('told', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it would be a while longer@#%^&*('be', 'told', 'U')	
before UAL resumed trading like a regular airline stock after months of gyrations.@#%^&*('resumed', 'longer', 'U')	
When Mr. Jacobson walked into the office at 7:30 a.m. EDT,@#%^&*('walked', 'announced', 'U')	('he', 'announced', 'U')	
he announced:@#%^&*('announced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"OK, buckle up."@#%^&*('buckle', 'announced', 'U')	
Messrs. Jacobson and Bates walked on the Big Board floor at about 8:45 a.m. yesterday@#%^&*('Jacobson', 'spotted', 'U')	('walked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and immediately spotted trouble.@#%^&*('spotted', 'walked', 'U')	
Already entered in the Big Board's computers and transmitted to their post were sell orders for 65,000 UAL shares.@#%^&*('entered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The UAL news had already caused a selling furor in the so-called third market,@#%^&*('caused', 'ROOT', 'R')	('market', 'buy', 'U')	
in which firms buy and sell stock away from the exchange floor.@#%^&*('buy', 'market', 'U')	('sell', 'market', 'U')	
UAL,@#%^&*('UAL', 'closed', 'U')	('UAL', 'traded', 'U')	
which closed on the Big Board Monday at $178.375 a share,@#%^&*('closed', 'UAL', 'U')	
traded in the third market afterward as low as $158 a share.@#%^&*('traded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
There were rumors of $148-a-share trades.@#%^&*('were', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In the 45 minutes before the 9:30 opening bell, the Jacobson specialists kept getting sell orders, heavier than they imagined.@#%^&*('kept', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And at 9:15, they posted a $135 to $155 "first indication," or the price range@#%^&*('posted', 'ROOT', 'R')	('range', 'open', 'U')	('the', 'stock', 'U')	
in which the stock would probably open.@#%^&*('open', 'range', 'U')	
That range was quickly narrowed to $145 to $155,@#%^&*('narrowed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
although traders@#%^&*('although', 'told', 'U')	('traders', 'told', 'U')	
surrounding the post@#%^&*('surrounding', 'traders', 'U')	
were told that $148 to $150 would be the likely target.@#%^&*('told', 'narrowed', 'U')	
When UAL finally opened a half hour late,@#%^&*('opened', 'traded', 'U')	
some 400,000 shares traded at $150.@#%^&*('traded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
There was "selling pressure from everyone,"@#%^&*('selling', 'said', 'U')	
said one trader.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
This month's Friday-the-13th market plunge@#%^&*('plunge', 'bad', 'U')	
spurred by UAL news@#%^&*('spurred', 'plunge', 'U')	
wasn't as bad for the Jacobson specialists as yesterday's action.@#%^&*('bad', 'ROOT', 'R')	
On that earlier day, the stock's trading was halted at a critical time@#%^&*('halted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
so the specialists could catch their breath.@#%^&*('catch', 'halted', 'U')	
Not yesterday.@#%^&*('Not', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Jacobson,@#%^&*('Jacobson', 'wear', 'U')	
his gray hair flying,@#%^&*('hair', 'Jacobson', 'U')	
didn't wear out his red-white-and-blue sneakers,@#%^&*('wear', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but he sweat so much@#%^&*('sweat', 'wear', 'U')	('he', 'considered', 'U')	
he considered sending out for a new shirt.@#%^&*('considered', 'sweat', 'U')	
Mr. Bates usually handles day-to-day UAL trading on his own.@#%^&*('handles', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But yesterday, the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only Messrs. Jacobson and Bates but four other Jacobson partners,@#%^&*('consumed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
all doing their specialist-firm job@#%^&*
of tugging buyers and sellers together@#%^&*('tugging', 'job', 'U')	
and adjusting prices@#%^&*('adjusting', 'job', 'U')	('adjusting', 'tugging', 'U')	
to accommodate the market.@#%^&*('accommodate', 'adjusting', 'U')	
About 30 floor traders crammed near the UAL post most of the day,@#%^&*('crammed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and probably hundreds more came and went@#%^&*('came', 'crammed', 'U')	('went', 'crammed', 'U')	('a', 'mass', 'U')	
-- a "seething mass,"@#%^&*('mass', 'came', 'U')	('as', 'described', 'U')	
as one trader described it.@#%^&*('described', 'mass', 'U')	
The 4.9 million-share volume@#%^&*('volume', 'normal', 'U')	
flowing through the Jacobson specialist operation@#%^&*('flowing', 'volume', 'U')	
was about five times normal for the stock.@#%^&*('normal', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The heavy buying in the last half hour led the specialists to take special steps.@#%^&*('led', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Bear Stearns order@#%^&*('order', 'said', 'U')	
that marked the late-day turnaround@#%^&*('marked', 'order', 'U')	('turnaround', 'caused', 'U')	
caused a "massive buying effort"@#%^&*('caused', 'marked', 'U')	('as', 'jumped', 'U')	
as UAL jumped $20 a share to $170 in the last half hour,@#%^&*('jumped', 'caused', 'U')	
said Mr. Bates.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
With 15 seconds of trading to go,@#%^&*('seconds', 'announced', 'U')	
Mr. Jacobson, with what voice@#%^&*('Jacobson', 'announced', 'U')	('voice', 'left', 'U')	
he had left,@#%^&*('left', 'Jacobson', 'U')	
announced to the trading mob:@#%^&*('announced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"We're going to trade one price on the bell."@#%^&*('going', 'announced', 'U')	
That meant no trading would occur in the final seconds, as a way@#%^&*('meant', 'ROOT', 'R')	
of making sure that last-second orders aren't subjected to a sudden price swing@#%^&*('making', 'way', 'U')	('swing', 'upset', 'U')	
that would upset customers.@#%^&*('upset', 'swing', 'U')	
About 11,000 shares sold at $170 on the bell,@#%^&*('sold', 'estimate', 'U')	
representing about eight to 10 late orders,@#%^&*('representing', 'sold', 'U')	
the specialists estimate.@#%^&*('estimate', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Big Board traders praised the Jacobson specialists for getting through yesterday without a trading halt.@#%^&*('praised', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In Chicago, a UAL spokesman, "by way of policy," declined to comment on the company's stock or the specialists' performance.@#%^&*('declined', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Leaving the exchange at about 5 p.m.,@#%^&*('Leaving', 'made', 'U')	('the', 'specialists', 'U')	
the Jacobson specialists made no predictions@#%^&*('made', 'ROOT', 'R')	
about how trading might go today.@#%^&*('go', 'made', 'U')	
Said Earl Ellis, a Jacobson partner@#%^&*('Said', 'ROOT', 'R')	('partner', 'involved', 'U')	
who got involved in the UAL action,@#%^&*('involved', 'partner', 'U')	
"It all starts all over again" today.@#%^&*('starts', 'Said', 'U')

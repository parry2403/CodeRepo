which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries.@#%^&*('have', 'countries', 'U')	
Meanwhile, the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan's steel quota,@#%^&*('U.S.', 'made', 'U')	('negotiated', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community.@#%^&*('made', 'negotiated', 'U')	
Brazil, similar to Mexico and South Korea, is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas,@#%^&*('had', 'negotiate', 'U')	
which expired Sept. 30.@#%^&*('expired', 'expected', 'U')	
Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries@#%^&*('countries', 'ROOT', 'R')	('countries', 'completed', 'U')

ending Oct. 1, 1990.@#%^&*('ending', 'year', 'U')	
In recent years, U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80% of the 100 million tons of steel@#%^&*('supplied', 'ROOT', 'R')	
used annually by the nation.@#%^&*('used', 'steel', 'U')	
Of the remaining 20% needed, the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15% to foreign suppliers, with the difference@#%^&*('allocate', 'ROOT', 'R')	
supplied mainly by Canada@#%^&*('supplied', 'difference', 'U')	('Canada', 'included', 'U')	
-- which isn't included in the quota program.@#%^&*('included', 'Canada', 'U')

Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S.@#%^&*('made', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that are similar to quotas.@#%^&*('similar', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Bush administration earlier this year said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it would extend steel quotas,@#%^&*('extend', 'said', 'U')	
known as voluntary restraint agreements,@#%^&*('known', 'quotas', 'U')	
until March 31, 1992.@#%^&*('March', 'extend', 'U')

The U.S. termed its plan, a "trade liberalization program,"@#%^&*('termed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
despite the fact@#%^&*('fact', 'termed', 'U')	
that it is merely an extension.@#%^&*('extension', 'termed', 'U')	
Mexico,@#%^&*('Mexico', 'one', 'U')	('Mexico', 'doubled', 'U')	
which was one of the first countries@#%^&*('one', 'Mexico', 'U')

That increase rises to slightly more than 2% of the U.S. market@#%^&*('rises', 'ROOT', 'R')

The EC and Japan@#%^&*('EC', 'filling', 'U')	('Japan', 'filling', 'U')

which has been coping with strong European demand,@#%^&*('coping', 'industry', 'U')	('has', 'supplying', 'U')	('been', 'supplying', 'U')

compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%.@#%^&*('with', 'supplying', 'U')	('quotas', 'supplying', 'U')	
Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5% of the U.S. market@#%^&*('shipping', 'ROOT', 'R')	
compared with a quota of 5.9%.@#%^&*('with', 'total', 'U')	('quota', 'total', 'U')	
In the recent talks, the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons, to 7% of the U.S. market from 6.7% in 1988.@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But its quota has been as high as 6.9% in 1984.@#%^&*('high', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Japan, however, has agreed to cut its quota to about 5% from 5.9% previously.@#%^&*('agreed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Japan, the EC, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea provide about 80% of the steel@#%^&*('provide', 'ROOT', 'R')	
imported to the U.S. under the quota program.@#%^&*('imported', 'steel', 'U')	
The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters, such as Australia and Venezuela.@#%^&*('supplied', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The U.S. had about an extra 2% of the domestic steel market@#%^&*('U.S.', 'give', 'U')	('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks.@#%^&*('give', 'had', 'U')	
That was essentially made up of a 1% increase in the overall quota program and 1% from cutting Japan's allowance.@#%^&*('made', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Negotiators from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year@#%^&*('repeat', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when they will have another 1% of the U.S. steel market to allocate.@#%^&*('have', 'repeat', 'U')

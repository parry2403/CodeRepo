United Airlines' parent should remain independent for now.@#%^&*('remain', 'saying', 'U')	
As a result, UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, pulled out of the buy-out effort@#%^&*('chairman', 'focus', 'U')	('pulled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to focus on running the company.@#%^&*('focus', 'pulled', 'U')	
The two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one@#%^&*('developments', 'leaves', 'U')	('put', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters,@#%^&*('leaves', 'put', 'U')	('an', 'situation', 'U')	
including an unsettled labor situation and a management@#%^&*('situation', 'put', 'U')	('management', 'put', 'U')

The effort@#%^&*('effort', 'began', 'U')	
to create the nation's largest employee-owned company@#%^&*('create', 'effort', 'U')	
began unraveling Oct. 13@#%^&*('began', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $300-a-share, $6.79 billion offer.@#%^&*('unable', 'began', 'U')	
Just last week it suffered another major setback@#%^&*('suffered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when British Airways PLC, the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid, withdrew its support.@#%^&*('withdrew', 'suffered', 'U')	
Takeover stock traders,@#%^&*('traders', 'took', 'U')	
focusing on the company's intention@#%^&*('focusing', 'traders', 'U')	
to stay independent,@#%^&*('stay', 'intention', 'U')	
took the announcement as bad news.@#%^&*('took', 'ROOT', 'R')	
UAL,@#%^&*('UAL', 'risen', 'U')	('UAL', 'reversed', 'U')	('UAL', 'plummeted', 'U')	
which had risen $9.875 to $178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid@#%^&*('risen', 'UAL', 'U')

and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement.@#%^&*('plummeted', 'reversed', 'U')	
Among the first trades@#%^&*('trades', 'shares', 'U')	
reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & Co.,@#%^&*('reported', 'trades', 'U')	('firm', 'makes', 'U')	('firm', 'shares', 'U')

The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading hours Monday was its first daily gain@#%^&*('gain', 'ROOT', 'R')	
after six consecutive losses left the price 41% below its level before Oct. 13, the day@#%^&*('losses', 'gain', 'U')	('the', 'group', 'U')	
the group announced@#%^&*('announced', 'day', 'U')	('the', 'financing', 'U')	
the bank financing couldn't be obtained for the original deal.@#%^&*('obtained', 'announced', 'U')	
Twelve of UAL's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in Chicago@#%^&*('met', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'consider', 'U')	
to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid.@#%^&*('consider', 'met', 'U')	
But the board said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it wasn't interested for now.@#%^&*('interested', 'said', 'U')	
That proposal,@#%^&*('proposal', 'transferred', 'U')	
valued at between $225 and $240 a share,@#%^&*('valued', 'proposal', 'U')	
would have transferred majority ownership to employees@#%^&*('transferred', 'ROOT', 'R')	
while leaving some stock in public hands.@#%^&*('leaving', 'transferred', 'U')	
The buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan.@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And, with no other offers on the table, the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it.@#%^&*('felt', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The directors signaled, however,@#%^&*('signaled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action@#%^&*('willing', 'signaled', 'U')	('to', 'maximize', 'U')	
to maximize shareholder value,@#%^&*('maximize', 'take', 'U')	
saying@#%^&*('saying', 'signaled', 'U')	
they would continue to explore "all strategic and financial alternatives."@#%^&*('continue', 'saying', 'U')	
But it was clear that for the time being, the board wants the company to return to normalcy.@#%^&*('clear', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The board said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it concluded@#%^&*('concluded', 'said', 'U')	
that "the welfare of the company, its shareholders, its employees and the broader public . . . can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong, viable, independent company."@#%^&*('enhanced', 'concluded', 'U')	
Mr. Wolf urged all employees to "now turn their full attention" to operating the airline.@#%^&*('urged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
He also vowed to "make every effort@#%^&*('vowed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'nurture', 'U')	
to nurture . . . a constructive new relationship@#%^&*('nurture', 'effort', 'U')	('relationship', 'forged', 'U')	
that has been forged with participating employee groups."@#%^&*('forged', 'relationship', 'U')	
But Mr. Wolf faces a monumental task@#%^&*('faces', 'ROOT', 'R')	
in pulling the company back together again.@#%^&*('pulling', 'faces', 'U')	
Labor problems top the list.@#%^&*('top', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For a brief time, the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with United's pilot union.@#%^&*('seemed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In return for an ownership stake in the company, the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract@#%^&*('willing', 'ROOT', 'R')	('contract', 'included', 'U')	
that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains@#%^&*('included', 'contract', 'U')	('clause', 'union', 'U')	('concessions', 'union', 'U')	
the union previously resisted.@#%^&*('union', 'included', 'U')	
That contract was tied to the success of the buy-out.@#%^&*('tied', 'ROOT', 'R')	
As a "good-will measure," the pilots had been working four extra hours a month@#%^&*('pilots', 'agreed', 'U')	('pilots', 'fly', 'U')	('working', 'ROOT', 'R')	('had', 'agreed', 'U')	
and had agreed to fly UAL's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft.@#%^&*('agreed', 'working', 'U')	
It's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so@#%^&*('uncertain', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'settlement', 'U')	
without a contract settlement.@#%^&*('settlement', 'do', 'U')	
The union said late last night@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that it is still committed to majority employee ownership@#%^&*('committed', 'said', 'U')	('that', 'disputes', 'U')	
and that the labor disputes@#%^&*('disputes', 'said', 'U')	('disputes', 'committed', 'U')	('that', 'need', 'U')	
that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort@#%^&*('faced', 'need', 'U')	
"still need to be addressed."@#%^&*('need', 'disputes', 'U')	
The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between United's pilot and machinist unions.@#%^&*('worsened', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The machinists' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike@#%^&*('criticisms', 'helped', 'U')	
unless they received substantial wage increases this year@#%^&*('received', 'criticisms', 'U')	
helped cool banks' interest@#%^&*('helped', 'ROOT', 'R')	
in financing the transaction.@#%^&*('financing', 'helped', 'U')	
The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. Wolf,@#%^&*('shown', 'ROOT', 'R')	('he', 'lost', 'U')	
but he lost much of his credibility with that group@#%^&*('lost', 'shown', 'U')	('group', 'teamed', 'U')	
when he teamed up with the pilot union.@#%^&*('teamed', 'group', 'U')	
The machinists criticized the terms@#%^&*('criticized', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out.@#%^&*('Wolf', 'terms', 'U')	('management', 'criticized', 'U')	('management', 'terms', 'U')	
They paid $15 million for a 1% stake@#%^&*('They', 'received', 'U')	('paid', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and received an additional 9% of the company at no additional cost.@#%^&*('received', 'paid', 'U')	
His credibility is also on the line in the investment community.@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Until the collapse of this bid, Mr. Wolf was regarded as one of the nation's savviest airline executives@#%^&*('regarded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
after engineering turnarounds of Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines.@#%^&*('turnarounds', 'regarded', 'U')	
But he and his chief financial officer, John Pope, sowed some of the seeds for the deal's failure@#%^&*('sowed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
by insisting@#%^&*('insisting', 'sowed', 'U')	
banks accept low financing fees and interest rates,@#%^&*('accept', 'insisting', 'U')	
while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $114.3 million@#%^&*('invested', 'sowed', 'U')	('they', 'stood', 'U')	('they', 'gain', 'U')	
they stood to gain from sale of their UAL stock and options.@#%^&*('stood', '$', 'U')	
The board's actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some $700 million in losses and eager to respond to anyone@#%^&*('leave', 'ROOT', 'R')	('anyone', 'make', 'U')	
who might make a new offer.@#%^&*('make', 'anyone', 'U')	
It also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits.@#%^&*('leaves', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Arbitragers said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they were disappointed@#%^&*('disappointed', 'said', 'U')	('the', 'company', 'U')	
the company didn't announce some recapitalization or other plan@#%^&*('announce', 'disappointed', 'U')	('recapitalization', 'maximize', 'U')	('plan', 'maximize', 'U')	
to maximize value.@#%^&*('maximize', 'announce', 'U')	
One takeover expert noted@#%^&*('noted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process@#%^&*('force', 'noted', 'U')	('process', 'oust', 'U')	
under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote.@#%^&*('oust', 'process', 'U')	
The machinists union has suggested@#%^&*('suggested', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it may propose a recapitalization@#%^&*('propose', 'suggested', 'U')	('recapitalization', 'includes', 'U')	
that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees.@#%^&*('includes', 'recapitalization', 'U')	
Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis,@#%^&*('Davis', 'offer', 'U')	('Davis', 'says', 'U')	
whose $240-a-share offer for UAL in August triggered a bidding war,@#%^&*('triggered', 'Davis', 'U')	
says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
he remains interested in the airline.@#%^&*('remains', 'says', 'U')	
However, he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement@#%^&*('restricted', 'ROOT', 'R')	('he', 'signed', 'U')	('he', 'obtain', 'U')	
he signed@#%^&*('signed', 'agreement', 'U')	
to obtain confidential UAL data.@#%^&*('obtain', 'signed', 'U')	
Essentially, he can't make any hostile moves@#%^&*('make', 'ROOT', 'R')	
unless he makes a tender offer at least $300 a share.@#%^&*

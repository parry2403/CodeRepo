The airline industry's fortunes, in dazzling shape for most of the year, have taken a sudden turn for the worse in the past few weeks.@#%^&*('taken', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Citing rising fuel costs, promotional fare cuts and a general slowdown in travel,@#%^&*('Citing', 'posted', 'U')	
several major carriers have posted or are expected to post relatively poor third-quarter results.@#%^&*('posted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Yesterday, USAir Group Inc., recently one of the industry's stellar performers, posted a worse-than-expected $77.7 million net loss for the period.@#%^&*('posted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
So far, the industry's fourth quarter isn't looking too strong either,@#%^&*('looking', 'ROOT', 'R')	
prompting many analysts to slash earning projections for the rest of the year by as much as one-fourth.@#%^&*('prompting', 'looking', 'U')	
And they say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'outlook', 'U')	
the outlook for 1990 is nearly as bad.@#%^&*('bad', 'say', 'U')	
Airlines in 1989 "came in like a bang@#%^&*('Airlines', 'going', 'U')	('came', 'said', 'U')	
and are going out like a whimper,"@#%^&*('going', 'came', 'U')	('going', 'said', 'U')	
said Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
This turn of events has put a big damper on an industry@#%^&*('put', 'ROOT', 'R')	('industry', 'seemed', 'U')	('industry', 'rising', 'U')	
that seemed almost invincible last spring,@#%^&*('seemed', 'industry', 'U')	
when fares were rising at double-digit rates@#%^&*('rising', 'seemed', 'U')	
and many carriers seemed to be growing fat on near-monopolies in certain markets.@#%^&*('seemed', 'rising', 'U')	
Now, many airline companies might become a lot less attractive as takeover targets on Wall Street.@#%^&*('become', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The downturn also raises questions about the carriers' ambitious orders for new airplanes,@#%^&*('raises', 'ROOT', 'R')	('airplanes', 'total', 'U')	
which currently total $32.5 billion over the next three years.@#%^&*('total', 'airplanes', 'U')	
For travelers, though, the industry's problems have had some positive effects.@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In recent weeks, airlines have cut numerous fares in leisure markets@#%^&*('cut', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to try to win back customers.@#%^&*('try', 'cut', 'U')	
Others have tried to spruce up frequent-flier programs.@#%^&*('tried', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Previously, airlines were limiting the programs@#%^&*('limiting', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because they were becoming too expensive.@#%^&*('becoming', 'limiting', 'U')	
Just last week, for example, Trans World Airlines and Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways went so far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of $200 to $1,000 to certain frequent-flier members@#%^&*('went', 'ROOT', 'R')	
making trans-Atlantic flights in business class or first class.@#%^&*('making', 'members', 'U')	
The industry's slowdown became apparent this month@#%^&*('became', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, reported an 8.8% drop in third-quarter net income@#%^&*('Corp.', 'said', 'U')	('reported', 'became', 'U')	
and said@#%^&*('said', 'became', 'U')	('said', 'reported', 'U')	
its fourth quarter would be "disappointing."@#%^&*('disappointing', 'said', 'U')	
Shortly before that, USAir had said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
its third-quarter results would be "significantly lower" than a year earlier.@#%^&*('lower', 'said', 'U')	
Yesterday, it provided the details:@#%^&*('provided', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Its loss of $77.7 million, or $1.86 a share, contrasted with net of $68.5 million, or $1.58 a share, in the 1988 third quarter.@#%^&*('loss', 'details', 'U')	
Revenue rose only 3.3% in the latest period, to $1.53 billion from $1.48 billion.@#%^&*('rose', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For the nine months, the Arlington, Va., company's net plunged 73% to $38.5 million, or 76 cents a share, from $142.2 million, or $3.28 a share.@#%^&*('plunged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Revenue rose 12% to $4.75 billion from $4.22 billion.@#%^&*('rose', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The results surprised many analysts,@#%^&*('surprised', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because USAir has almost no competition in its Pittsburgh hub@#%^&*('USAir', 'expanded', 'U')	('has', 'surprised', 'U')	('has', 'expanded', 'U')	
and has expanded operations@#%^&*('expanded', 'surprised', 'U')	
by completing its acquisition of Piedmont Airlines.@#%^&*('completing', 'expanded', 'U')	
Shortly after announcing its quarterly loss,@#%^&*('Shortly', 'tumbled', 'U')	('announcing', 'tumbled', 'U')	
USAir's stock tumbled $3 a share.@#%^&*('tumbled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It ended at $40.125, down $2.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.@#%^&*('ended', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Nobody was expecting this size of a loss,"@#%^&*('expecting', 'said', 'U')	
said Paul Karos, an analyst with First Boston Corp.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
One airline executive,@#%^&*('executive', 'declined', 'U')	('executive', 'identified', 'U')	('executive', 'called', 'U')	
who declined to be identified,@#%^&*('declined', 'executive', 'U')	
called the loss "amazing."@#%^&*('called', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In announcing the results,@#%^&*('announcing', 'cited', 'U')	
USAir cited many of the same problems@#%^&*('cited', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that several other industry officials have named recently.@#%^&*('named', 'cited', 'U')	
It said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the industry's domestic traffic was flat in the third quarter;@#%^&*('flat', 'said', 'U')	
analysts say@#%^&*('say', 'said', 'U')	
this was because hefty fare increases earlier in the year scared off many leisure travelers this summer.@#%^&*('was', 'say', 'U')	
To try to combat the traffic slowdown,@#%^&*('try', 'started', 'U')	
airlines started reducing fares;@#%^&*('started', 'ROOT', 'R')	
average fares rose only 1.7% in August, in contrast to increases of 16% each in February and March.@#%^&*('rose', 'started', 'U')	
But so far, the effort has failed,@#%^&*('failed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and traffic is still slow.@#%^&*('slow', 'failed', 'U')	
Some other fare promotions have backfired.@#%^&*('backfired', 'ROOT', 'R')	
This summer, the industry introduced a "kids fly free" program,@#%^&*('introduced', 'ROOT', 'R')	('program', 'allowed', 'U')	
in which children were allowed to fly free@#%^&*('allowed', 'program', 'U')	
if they were traveling with an adult.@#%^&*('traveling', 'fly', 'U')	
Airlines tried to restrict the program substantially@#%^&*('tried', 'ROOT', 'R')	
by limiting the offer to certain days of the week,@#%^&*('limiting', 'restrict', 'U')	('it', 'used', 'U')	
but it still was apparently used far more heavily@#%^&*('used', 'tried', 'U')	
than the airlines expected.@#%^&*('airlines', 'used', 'U')	
Airlines also say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
their frequent-flier programs are squeezing profits@#%^&*('squeezing', 'say', 'U')	
because awards are being redeemed at a heavier-than-normal rate.@#%^&*('redeemed', 'squeezing', 'U')	
One airline official said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
about three times as many free-travel coupons are being turned in as in previous years@#%^&*('turned', 'said', 'U')	
-- not surprisingly, as the airlines last year allowed many travelers to build up mileage at triple the normal rate.@#%^&*('surprisingly', 'turned', 'U')	('allowed', 'turned', 'U')	
Rising operating expenses are another problem.@#%^&*('problem', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Fuel costs were up 10% in the third quarter.@#%^&*('were', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Labor costs,@#%^&*('costs', 'leveled', 'U')	('costs', 'are', 'U')	
which leveled off in the past few years@#%^&*('leveled', 'costs', 'U')	
because of lower pay scales for newer employees,@#%^&*('scales', 'years', 'U')	
are on the upswing again at many carriers.@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And some carriers are facing other unexpected headaches:@#%^&*('facing', 'ROOT', 'R')	
USAir, for example, blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions@#%^&*('blamed', 'facing', 'U')	
caused by Hurricane Hugo last month.@#%^&*('caused', 'disruptions', 'U')	
"We cannot quantify the total adverse effects of Hugo,"@#%^&*('quantify', 'said', 'U')	
said Edwin Colodny, chairman and president of USAir Group.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Whatever the cause for the downturn, few people are predicting any sudden improvement.@#%^&*('predicting', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Airline Economics Inc., an aviation consulting firm, is projecting an industrywide operating profit of $2.5 billion for 1989,@#%^&*('projecting', 'ROOT', 'R')	
compared with earlier forecasts of $3 billion to $3.5 billion.@#%^&*('with', 'projecting', 'U')	('forecasts', 'projecting', 'U')	
As for 1990, the firm predicts@#%^&*('predicts', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that profit will slip to between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.@#%^&*('slip', 'predicts', 'U')

General Electric Co. executives and lawyers provided "misleading and false" information to the Pentagon in 1985 in an effort@#%^&*('provided', 'alleged', 'U')	('to', 'cover', 'U')	
to cover up "longstanding fraudulent" billing practices,@#%^&*('cover', 'effort', 'U')	
federal prosecutors alleged in legal briefs.@#%^&*('alleged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The government's startling allegations,@#%^&*('allegations', 'challenge', 'U')	
filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against GE in Philadelphia federal district court,@#%^&*('filed', 'allegations', 'U')	
challenge the motives and veracity of the nation's third-largest defense contractor.@#%^&*('challenge', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In a strongly worded response@#%^&*('response', 'asserted', 'U')	
summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday,@#%^&*('summarizing', 'response', 'U')	
GE asserted that@#%^&*('asserted', 'ROOT', 'R')	('that', 'misstated', 'U')	
"prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses,@#%^&*('prosecutors', 'distorted', 'U')	('prosecutors', 'ignored', 'U')	('misstated', 'asserted', 'U')	
distorted documents@#%^&*('distorted', 'asserted', 'U')	('distorted', 'misstated', 'U')	
and ignored important facts."@#%^&*('ignored', 'asserted', 'U')	('ignored', 'misstated', 'U')	
The company attacked the government's allegations as "reckless and baseless mudslinging,"@#%^&*('company', 'said', 'U')	('attacked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and said@#%^&*('said', 'attacked', 'U')	
its management "promptly and accurately reported" to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices.@#%^&*('reported', 'said', 'U')	
The case strikes at the corporate image of GE,@#%^&*('strikes', 'ROOT', 'R')	('image', 'provides', 'U')	('image', 'cause', 'U')	
which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative,@#%^&*('provides', 'image', 'U')	
and could cause a loss of future defense contracts@#%^&*('cause', 'image', 'U')	('cause', 'provides', 'U')	
if Pentagon and Justice Department officials take a tough stance.@#%^&*('take', 'cause', 'U')	
The company has been considered an industry leader@#%^&*('considered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices.@#%^&*('advocating', 'considered', 'U')	
But the government now claims@#%^&*('claims', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years@#%^&*('group', 'obscure', 'U')	('engaged', 'claims', 'U')	
to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of "widespread" fraudulent billing practices.@#%^&*('obscure', 'engaged', 'U')	
The problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company's Space Systems division,@#%^&*('uncovered', 'ROOT', 'R')	('series', 'focus', 'U')	
which has been the focus of two separate overcharge prosecutions by the government since 1985.@#%^&*('focus', 'series', 'U')	
The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case,@#%^&*('stems', 'ROOT', 'R')	('case', 'demanding', 'U')	
in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos, reports and documents.@#%^&*('demanding', 'case', 'U')	
Last November, a federal grand jury indicted GE on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme@#%^&*('indicted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to defraud the Army of $21 million on a logistics computer contract.@#%^&*('defraud', 'scheme', 'U')	
The company, for its part, maintains@#%^&*('maintains', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney-client communications@#%^&*('communications', 'maintains', 'U')	('communications', 'turned', 'U')	
that shouldn't be turned over to prosecutors.@#%^&*('turned', 'communications', 'U')	
A hearing is scheduled on the issue today.@#%^&*('scheduled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The government's 136-page filing covers events@#%^&*('covers', 'ROOT', 'R')	
leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985,@#%^&*('leading', 'events', 'U')	
when GE was accused of defrauding the Pentagon@#%^&*('accused', 'leading', 'U')	
by illegally claiming cost overruns on Minuteman missile contracts.@#%^&*('claiming', 'defrauding', 'U')	
GE pleaded guilty@#%^&*('GE', 'paid', 'U')	('pleaded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and paid a fine of more than $1 million in the Minuteman case,@#%^&*('paid', 'pleaded', 'U')	('case', 'involved', 'U')	
which involved some of the same individuals and operations@#%^&*('involved', 'case', 'U')	('individuals', 'are', 'U')	('operations', 'are', 'U')	
that are at the center of the dispute in the Philadelphia court.@#%^&*('are', 'individuals', 'U')	
In order to show@#%^&*('show', 'contend', 'U')	
that all of its units had corrected billing problems@#%^&*('all', 'become', 'U')	('corrected', 'show', 'U')	
and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts,@#%^&*('become', 'show', 'U')	('become', 'corrected', 'U')	
prosecutors contend that@#%^&*('contend', 'ROOT', 'R')	('that', 'provided', 'U')	
"high-level GE executives" and company lawyers provided "misleading statements" to then-Air Force Secretary Verne Orr and other Pentagon officials during a series of meetings in 1985.@#%^&*('provided', 'contend', 'U')	
Overall, the government contends@#%^&*('contends', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that GE's disclosure efforts largely were intended to "curry favor" with Pentagon officials@#%^&*('intended', 'contends', 'U')	
without detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities@#%^&*('detailing', 'curry', 'U')	
uncovered by company investigations.@#%^&*('uncovered', 'lapses', 'U')	
Prosecutors depict a company@#%^&*('depict', 'ROOT', 'R')	('company', 'sat', 'U')	
that allegedly sat on damaging evidence of overcharges from 1983 to 1985,@#%^&*('sat', 'company', 'U')	
despite warnings from an internal auditor.@#%^&*('warnings', 'sat', 'U')	
When GE finally disclosed the problems,@#%^&*('disclosed', 'contend', 'U')	
prosecutors contend@#%^&*('contend', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Mr. Orr "was erroneously informed that the {suspected} practices had only just been discovered" by GE management.@#%^&*('informed', 'contend', 'U')	
In its brief, the government asserted@#%^&*('asserted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that it needs the internal GE documents@#%^&*('needs', 'asserted', 'U')	('documents', 'rebut', 'U')	
to rebut anticipated efforts by GE during the trial@#%^&*('rebut', 'needs', 'U')	('to', 'demonstrate', 'U')	
to demonstrate "its good corporate character."@#%^&*('demonstrate', 'trial', 'U')	
GE,@#%^&*('GE', 'surprised', 'U')	('GE', 'countered', 'U')	
which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents,@#%^&*('surprised', 'GE', 'U')	
countered@#%^&*('countered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that senior GE managers didn't find out about questionable billing practices until 1985,@#%^&*('find', 'countered', 'U')	('that', 'passed', 'U')	
and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. Orr at his first meeting with company representatives.@#%^&*('passed', 'countered', 'U')	('passed', 'find', 'U')	
Subsequent meetings,@#%^&*('meetings', 'held', 'U')	
initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts,@#%^&*('initiated', 'meetings', 'U')	('were', 'held', 'U')	
were held@#%^&*('held', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to familiarize Mr. Orr with the company's self-policing procedures@#%^&*('familiarize', 'held', 'U')	('to', 'disclose', 'U')	
and to disclose additional information,@#%^&*('disclose', 'held', 'U')	('disclose', 'familiarize', 'U')	('to', 'held', 'U')	
according to GE.@#%^&*('GE', 'held', 'U')	
GE's filing contends@#%^&*('contends', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity.@#%^&*('involved', 'contends', 'U')	
The company's conduct "does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent, ratification or cover-up,"@#%^&*('raise', 'asserts', 'U')	
GE's brief asserts.@#%^&*('asserts', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"On the contrary, it shows a corporation@#%^&*('shows', 'ROOT', 'R')	
reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters."@#%^&*('reacting', 'corporation', 'U')	
Mr. Orr couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.@#%^&*('reached', 'ROOT', 'R')

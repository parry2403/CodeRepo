caused by the earthquake,@#%^&*('caused', 'damages', 'U')	
Aetna pulled together a team of its most experienced claims adjusters from around the country.@#%^&*('pulled', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Even so, few had ever dealt with an earthquake.@#%^&*('dealt', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Some adjusters, like Alan Singer of San Diego, had been working in Charleston for nearly four weeks.@#%^&*('working', 'ROOT', 'R')

"You have to count everything."@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Adjusters must count the number of bathrooms, balconies, fireplaces, chimneys, microwaves and dishwashers.@#%^&*('count', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But they must also assign a price to each of these items as well as to floors, wallcoverings, roofing and siding,@#%^&*('assign', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'come', 'U')	
to come up with a total value for a house.@#%^&*('come', 'assign', 'U')

they must think in terms of sheetrock by the square foot, carpeting by the square yard, wallpaper by the roll, molding by the linear foot.@#%^&*('think', 'do', 'U')	('molding', 'ROOT', 'R')

Sometimes repairs are out of the question.@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')

he found them living in a mobile home@#%^&*('found', 'ROOT', 'R')	
parked in front of their yard.@#%^&*('parked', 'home', 'U')

was pushed about four feet off its foundation@#%^&*('pushed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and then collapsed into its basement.@#%^&*('collapsed', 'pushed', 'U')

A friend mentioned@#%^&*('mentioned', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that she might want to look into a position at Aetna,@#%^&*('want', 'mentioned', 'U')	
if she was interested in a job@#%^&*('interested', 'look', 'U')	('job', 'challenge', 'U')	
that would constantly challenge her.@#%^&*('challenge', 'job', 'U')	
She signed up,@#%^&*('signed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
starting as an "inside" adjuster,@#%^&*('starting', 'signed', 'U')	('adjuster', 'settles', 'U')	('adjuster', 'does', 'U')

A year later, she moved to the commercial property claims division.@#%^&*('moved', 'ROOT', 'R')

As Ms. Johnson stands outside the Hammack house@#%^&*('stands', 'begins', 'U')	
after winding up her chores there,@#%^&*('winding', 'stands', 'U')	('the', 'house', 'U')	
the house begins to creak and sway.@#%^&*('begins', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The ground shakes underneath her.@#%^&*('shakes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It is an aftershock, one of about 2,000 since the earthquake,@#%^&*('aftershock', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and it makes her uneasy.@#%^&*('makes', 'aftershock', 'U')	
The next day,@#%^&*('day', 'jumps', 'U')	
as she prepares a $10,000 check for the Hammacks,@#%^&*('prepares', 'jumps', 'U')	('check', 'cover', 'U')

of demolishing the house@#%^&*('demolishing', 'cost', 'U')	
and clearing away the debris,@#%^&*('clearing', 'cost', 'U')	('clearing', 'demolishing', 'U')	
she jumps at the slightest noise.@#%^&*('jumps', 'ROOT', 'R')	
On further reflection, she admits@#%^&*('admits', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that venturing inside the Hammacks ' house the previous day wasn't" such a great idea."@#%^&*('venturing', 'admits', 'U')	
During her second meeting with the Hammacks, Ms. Johnson reviews exactly what their policy covers.@#%^&*('reviews', 'ROOT', 'R')	
They would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor,@#%^&*('They', 'wonder', 'U')	('like', 'ROOT', 'R')

that,@#%^&*('that', 'covers', 'U')	
if the appliances can't be salvaged,@#%^&*('salvaged', 'covers', 'U')	
their policy covers the replacement cost.@#%^&*('covers', 'tells', 'U')	
Mr. Hammack is eager to know@#%^&*('eager', 'ROOT', 'R')

The adjuster hadn't completed all the calculations,@#%^&*('adjuster', 'says', 'U')	('completed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but says@#%^&*('says', 'completed', 'U')	
: "We 're talking policy limits."@#%^&*('talking', 'completed', 'U')	
In this case, that's about $250,000.@#%^&*('$', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It suddenly dawns on Mr. Hammack@#%^&*('dawns', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that rebuilding the house in Los Gatos, an affluent community in Santa Clara County, may cost@#%^&*('cost', 'dawns', 'U')	
more than Aetna's policy will pay.@#%^&*('more', 'cost', 'U')	
"We can lose money on this,"@#%^&*('lose', 'says', 'U')	
he says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"And you didn't want me to buy earthquake insurance,"@#%^&*('want', 'says', 'U')

reaching across the table@#%^&*('reaching', 'says', 'U')

Earthquake insurance costs about $to $ annually for every $1,000 of value,@#%^&*('costs', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and high deductibles mean it generally pays@#%^&*('mean', 'costs', 'U')	
only when there is a catastrophe.@#%^&*('only', 'pays', 'U')	('is', 'pays', 'U')	
So, many Californians believe@#%^&*('believe', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they can get by@#%^&*('get', 'believe', 'U')	
without it.@#%^&*('without', 'by', 'U')	
Even Ms. Johnson herself made that assumption.@#%^&*('made', 'ROOT', 'R')

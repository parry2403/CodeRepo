CHICAGO -@#%^&*('CHICAGO', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Sears, Roebuck & Co. is struggling@#%^&*('struggling', 'CHICAGO', 'U')	
as it enters the critical Christmas season.@#%^&*('enters', 'struggling', 'U')	
Yesterday, the retailing and financial services giant reported a 16% drop in third-quarter earnings to $257.5 million, or 75 cents a share, from a restated $305 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier.@#%^&*('reported', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the news was even worse for Sears's core U.S. retailing operation, the largest in the nation.@#%^&*('worse', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Sears said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
its U.S. stores had a loss of $6.9 million, their first deficit for the period in more than five years.@#%^&*('had', 'said', 'U')	
Analysts estimated@#%^&*('estimated', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that sales at U.S. stores declined in the quarter, too.@#%^&*('declined', 'estimated', 'U')	
The results underscore Sears's difficulties@#%^&*('underscore', 'ROOT', 'R')	
in implementing the "everyday low pricing" strategy@#%^&*('implementing', 'underscore', 'U')	
that it adopted in March as part of a broad attempt@#%^&*('it', 'revive', 'U')	('adopted', 'strategy', 'U')	
to revive its retailing business.@#%^&*('revive', 'adopted', 'U')	
Under the new approach, Sears set prices@#%^&*('set', 'ROOT', 'R')	('prices', 'were', 'U')	
that were somewhere between its old "regular" and "sale" prices.@#%^&*
The company said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
it would resort far less often to slashing prices@#%^&*('resort', 'said', 'U')	('to', 'woo', 'U')	
to woo shoppers.@#%^&*('woo', 'slashing', 'U')	
Sears officials insist@#%^&*('insist', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they don't intend to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results.@#%^&*('intend', 'insist', 'U')	
Instead, a spokesman blames the dismal third-quarter showing on "an environment@#%^&*('blames', 'ROOT', 'R')	('environment', 'distorted', 'U')	('environment', 'account', 'U')	('is', 'distorted', 'U')	
that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods,"@#%^&*('distorted', 'environment', 'U')	
which account for roughly two-thirds of Sears's annual merchandise volume.@#%^&*('account', 'environment', 'U')	
The new pricing strategy "is working,"@#%^&*('working', 'asserted', 'U')	
the spokesman asserted.@#%^&*('asserted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
He added@#%^&*('added', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that,@#%^&*('that', 'expected', 'U')	
after an initial surge@#%^&*('surge', 'expected', 'U')	
triggered by an advertising blitz in March,@#%^&*('triggered', 'surge', 'U')	
Sears expected@#%^&*('expected', 'added', 'U')	
that the pricing program wouldn't have any effect on revenue.@#%^&*('have', 'expected', 'U')	
Sears has been counting on growth@#%^&*('counting', 'ROOT', 'R')	
coming from the large displays of brand-name merchandise@#%^&*('coming', 'growth', 'U')	
it is adding to its stores over the next two years@#%^&*('adding', 'merchandise', 'U')	('stores', 'calls', 'U')	('it', 'calls', 'U')	
in what it calls "power formats."@#%^&*('calls', 'stores', 'U')	
But analysts say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Sears faces an especially daunting challenge on the eve of the Christmas shopping season.@#%^&*('faces', 'say', 'U')	
"I believe@#%^&*('believe', 'says', 'U')	
everyday pricing in the current environment doesn't work,"@#%^&*('work', 'believe', 'U')	
says Walter Loeb of Morgan Stanley & Co.,@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
pointing to soft durable-goods sales.@#%^&*('pointing', 'says', 'U')	
"Sears is likely to be unsuccessful@#%^&*('likely', 'ROOT', 'R')	
if it continues with its pricing policy@#%^&*('continues', 'unsuccessful', 'U')	
when everyone else is offering unusual values."@#%^&*('offering', 'continues', 'U')	
In what amounts to an admission@#%^&*('In', 'trying', 'U')	
that the transition hasn't gone as smoothly@#%^&*('gone', 'amounts', 'U')	('as', 'hoped', 'U')	
as Sears had hoped,@#%^&*('hoped', 'smoothly', 'U')	('hoped', 'smoothly', 'U')	
the giant retailer is now trying new ways@#%^&*('trying', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to drum up business@#%^&*('drum', 'trying', 'U')	
without appearing to abandon its seven-month-old strategy.@#%^&*('appearing', 'drum', 'U')	
The company is highlighting more special deals in its advertising and stores,@#%^&*('highlighting', 'ROOT', 'R')	('it', 'offering', 'U')	('it', 'defer', 'U')	
and it's offering to defer finance charges on certain big-ticket items.@#%^&*('offering', 'highlighting', 'U')	
Sears is also stepping up its television ads@#%^&*('Sears', 'changing', 'U')	('stepping', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and changing its message.@#%^&*('changing', 'stepping', 'U')	
In a new TV ad, for instance, a woman@#%^&*('ad', 'claims', 'U')	('instance', 'claims', 'U')	('woman', 'claims', 'U')	
going through the Sunday newspaper@#%^&*('going', 'woman', 'U')	('the', 'brands', 'U')	('Sunday', 'brands', 'U')	('newspaper', 'brands', 'U')	
brands as hype claims by other stores@#%^&*('brands', 'going', 'U')	('hype', 'going', 'U')	('claims', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that they are offering goods for "50%, 60% and 70% off."@#%^&*('offering', 'claims', 'U')	
By lowering prices throughout its stores,@#%^&*('lowering', 'has', 'U')	
she says,@#%^&*('says', 'has', 'U')	
"Sears has the right idea."@#%^&*('has', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the ad also mentions Sears's sales@#%^&*('mentions', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'topic', 'U')	
-- a topic@#%^&*('topic', 'sales', 'U')	
that the retailer has avoided@#%^&*('avoided', 'topic', 'U')	
since switching to everyday pricing.@#%^&*('switching', 'avoided', 'U')	
"When Sears has a sale at a special price,"@#%^&*('has', 'something', 'U')	
the woman in the ad declares,@#%^&*('declares', 'something', 'U')	
"it's something@#%^&*('something', 'ROOT', 'R')	
you don't want to miss."@#%^&*('want', 'something', 'U')	
Recent surveys by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a market research firm in Chicago, suggest@#%^&*('suggest', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Sears is having a tough time@#%^&*('having', 'suggest', 'U')	
attracting shoppers@#%^&*('attracting', 'having', 'U')	
because it hasn't yet done enough@#%^&*('done', 'having', 'U')	
to improve service or its selection of merchandise.@#%^&*('improve', 'enough', 'U')	
The number of people@#%^&*('number', 'fell', 'U')	('people', 'said', 'U')

they were more likely to shop at Sears@#%^&*('likely', 'said', 'U')

Just 5% of the respondents mentioned brands in September, up slightly from 2% in March.@#%^&*('mentioned', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Only 2% of the people in September cited Sears's "friendly personnel."@#%^&*('cited', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"The power of price as an appeal,@#%^&*('power', 'considerable', 'U')	('power', 'diminished', 'U')	
which was very considerable in driving traffic in March and April,@#%^&*('considerable', 'power', 'U')	
has diminished,"@#%^&*('diminished', 'says', 'U')	
says George Rosenbaum, president of Shapiro & Associates.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"You see some improvement in these other areas,@#%^&*('see', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but it's a very small and slow process."@#%^&*('process', 'see', 'U')

Allstate is expected to absorb another big hit in the fourth quarter@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as claims pour in from the San Francisco earthquake.@#%^&*('pour', 'absorb', 'U')	
But a spokesman said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the quake won't have as big a financial impact on Allstate@#%^&*('have', 'said', 'U')	('as', 'did', 'U')	
as Hurricane Hugo did.@#%^&*('did', 'have', 'U')

Claude Bebear, chairman and chief executive officer, of Axa-Midi Assurances, pledged to retain employees and management of Farmers Group Inc.,@#%^&*1
including Leo E. Denlea Jr., chairman and chief executive officer,@#%^&*1
if Axa succeeds in acquiring Farmers.@#%^&*1
Mr. Bebear added@#%^&*2
that the French insurer would keep Farmers' headquarters in Los Angeles@#%^&*2
and "will not send French people@#%^&*2
to run the company."@#%^&*2
Axa would also maintain Farmers' relationships with the insurance exchanges@#%^&*3
that it manages.@#%^&*3
Mr. Bebear made his remarks at a breakfast meeting with reporters here yesterday as part of a tour@#%^&*4
in which he is trying to rally support in the U.S. for the proposed acquisition.@#%^&*4
The bid is part of Sir James Goldsmith's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC, the British tobacco, retailing, paper and financial-services giant@#%^&*5
that acquired Farmers last year for $5.2 billion.@#%^&*5
Axa has agreed to acquire Farmers from Sir James's investment vehicle, Hoylake Investments Ltd., for $4.5 billion plus a $1 billion investment in Hoylake.@#%^&*6
Any acquisition of Farmers needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine states@#%^&*7
where Farmers operates,@#%^&*7
and Mr. Bebear's trip will take him to Idaho, Arizona and New York after his stay here;@#%^&*7
he will meet with insurance regulators, legislators, industry excutives and the press.@#%^&*7
Hearings on Axa's acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in Idaho; Nov. 20 in Illinois; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in Arizona; Dec. 11 in Washington state; and Jan. 8 in Oregon.@#%^&*8
Hearings haven't yet been set in Texas, Ohio and Kansas.@#%^&*9
California's insurance commissioner doesn't hold hearings on acquisition applications.@#%^&*10
Although Axa has been rebuffed by Farmers@#%^&*11
and hasn't had any meetings with management,@#%^&*11
Mr. Bebear nonetheless appears to be trying to woo the company's executives with promises of autonomy and new-found authority under Axa.@#%^&*11
He said@#%^&*12
Mr. Denlea would be a member of the top management team of the Axa-Midi group of companies,@#%^&*12
and would "help define policies and strategies of the group."@#%^&*12
Farmers was quick yesterday to point out the many negative aspects@#%^&*13
it sees@#%^&*13
in having Axa as its parent.@#%^&*13
For one, Axa plans to do away with certain tax credits@#%^&*14
that have resulted in more than $600 million@#%^&*14
paid to the Farmers exchanges during the past few years@#%^&*14
to offset underwriting losses.@#%^&*14
Those credits result@#%^&*15
because of taxes@#%^&*15
that Farmers, as the management company, has paid,@#%^&*15
and have "proved to be very important for the exchanges,"@#%^&*15
a Farmers spokesman said.@#%^&*15
Mr. Bebear contended@#%^&*16
that the tax cost to the exchanges under the revised structure would be about $8 million a year,@#%^&*16
which he described as "peanuts."@#%^&*16

Energetic and concrete action has been taken in Colombia during the past 60 days against the mafiosi of the drug trade,@#%^&*('taken', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but it has not been sufficiently effective,@#%^&*('effective', 'taken', 'U')	
because, unfortunately, it came too late.@#%^&*('came', 'effective', 'U')	
Ten years ago, the newspaper El Espectador,@#%^&*('ago', 'began', 'U')	('Espectador', 'editor', 'U')	('Espectador', 'began', 'U')	
of which my brother Guillermo was editor,@#%^&*('editor', 'Espectador', 'U')	
began warning of the rise of the drug mafias and of their leaders' aspirations@#%^&*('began', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to control Colombian politics, especially the Congress.@#%^&*('control', 'aspirations', 'U')	
Then,@#%^&*('Then', 'done', 'U')	
when it would have been easier to resist them,@#%^&*('easier', 'done', 'U')	
nothing was done@#%^&*('done', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and my brother was murdered by the drug mafias three years ago.@#%^&*('murdered', 'done', 'U')	
The most ruthless dictatorships have not censored their press more brutally than the drug mafias censor Colombia's.@#%^&*('censored', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The censorship is enforced through terrorism and assassination.@#%^&*('enforced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In the past 10 years about 50 journalists have been silenced forever, murdered.@#%^&*('silenced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the El Espectador in Bogota,@#%^&*('exploded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
destroying a major part of its installations and equipment.@#%^&*('destroying', 'exploded', 'U')	
And only last week the newspaper Vanguardia Liberal in the city of Bucaramanga was bombed,@#%^&*('bombed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and its installations destroyed.@#%^&*('destroyed', 'bombed', 'U')	
Journalists and their families are constantly threatened@#%^&*('threatened', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as are the newspaper distribution outlets.@#%^&*('outlets', 'threatened', 'U')	
Distribution centers are bombed,@#%^&*('bombed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and advertisers are intimidated.@#%^&*('intimidated', 'bombed', 'U')	
Censorship is imposed by terrorism.@#%^&*('imposed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
If the Colombian media accept this new and hideous censorship@#%^&*
there is little doubt@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that the drug mafia's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers@#%^&*
published in the free world.@#%^&*('published', 'newspapers', 'U')	
The solidarity of the uncensored media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way@#%^&*('solidarity', 'freedom', 'U')	('world', 'freedom', 'U')	('is', 'freedom', 'U')	('the', 'freedom', 'U')	('only', 'freedom', 'U')	('way', 'freedom', 'U')	
press freedom can survive.@#%^&*('freedom', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The American people and their government also woke up too late to the menace@#%^&*('woke', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'drugs', 'U')	('menace', 'drugs', 'U')	
drugs posed to the moral structure of their country.@#%^&*('drugs', 'woke', 'U')	
Even now, the American attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat.@#%^&*('timid', 'ROOT', 'R')	
I can attest@#%^&*('attest', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that a recent Colombian visitor to the U.S. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks' walk between Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan.@#%^&*('offered', 'attest', 'U')	
Colombia alone@#%^&*('Colombia', 'have', 'U')	
-- its government, its people, its newspapers--@#%^&*('government', 'Colombia', 'U')	
does not have the capacity@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to fight this battle successfully.@#%^&*('fight', 'capacity', 'U')	
All drug-consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs.@#%^&*('decide', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The U.S., as the major drug consumer, should lead this joint effort.@#%^&*('lead', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Reduction, if not the total cessation, of drug consumption is the requirement for victory.@#%^&*('requirement', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Much is being done in Colombia@#%^&*('Much', 'fight', 'U')	('done', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to fight the drug cartel mafia.@#%^&*('fight', 'done', 'U')	
Luxurious homes and ranches have been raided by the military authorities,@#%^&*('raided', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized.@#%^&*('seized', 'raided', 'U')	
More than 300 planes and helicopters have been impounded at airports,@#%^&*('impounded', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'number', 'U')	
and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated.@#%^&*('confiscated', 'impounded', 'U')	
The military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons, explosives and other war-like materiel.@#%^&*('captured', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Much has been accomplished@#%^&*('accomplished', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and public opinion decisively supports the government and the army@#%^&*('supports', 'accomplished', 'U')	('the', 'hand', 'U')	
-- but, on the other hand, none of the key drug barons have been captured.@#%^&*('captured', 'accomplished', 'U')	
There has been a lot of talk@#%^&*('lot', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that a large portion of the Colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money.@#%^&*('sustained', 'lot', 'U')	
In my opinion, this is not true.@#%^&*('true', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Laundered drug money has served only to increase, unrealistically, the price of real estate,@#%^&*('served', 'ROOT', 'R')	
creating serious problems for low-income people@#%^&*('creating', 'increase', 'U')	('problems', 'aspire', 'U')	('problems', 'own', 'U')	
who aspire to own their own homes.@#%^&*('aspire', 'problems', 'U')	
Drug money has also gone@#%^&*('money', 'buy', 'U')	('gone', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to buy expensive cars, airplanes, launches and nightclubs@#%^&*('buy', 'gone', 'U')	
where drugs are consumed.@#%^&*('consumed', 'buy', 'U')	
But most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside Colombia.@#%^&*('kept', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In fact, the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle.@#%^&*('essential', 'ROOT', 'R')	
What is of much more importance to the Colombian economy than the supposed benefits of laundered drug money is higher prices for Colombia 's legitimate products.@#%^&*('prices', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The price of coffee has gone down almost 45% since the beginning of the year, to the lowest level@#%^&*('gone', 'ROOT', 'R')	
(after inflation)@#%^&*('inflation', 'level', 'U')	
since the Great Depression.@#%^&*('Depression', 'gone', 'U')	
Market conditions point to even lower prices next year.@#%^&*('point', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The 27-year-old coffee cartel had to be formally dissolved this summer.@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
As a result, Colombia will earn $500 million less from its coffee this year than last.@#%^&*('earn', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Our coffee growers face reductions in their income,@#%^&*('face', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and this tempts them to contemplate substituting coca crops for coffee.@#%^&*('tempts', 'face', 'U')	
U.S. interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important Colombian export@#%^&*('try', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- cut flowers --@#%^&*('flowers', 'export', 'U')	
into the American market.@#%^&*('market', 'impose', 'U')	
A just price and an open market@#%^&*('price', 'policy', 'U')	('market', 'produces', 'U')	('market', 'policy', 'U')	
for what Colombian produces and exports@#%^&*('produces', 'market', 'U')	('exports', 'market', 'U')	
should be the policy of the U.S.@#%^&*('policy', 'ROOT', 'R')	
I take advantage of this opportunity@#%^&*('take', 'ROOT', 'R')	
given to me by The Wall Street Journal@#%^&*('given', 'opportunity', 'U')	('to', 'make', 'U')	
to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper,@#%^&*('make', 'given', 'U')	('to', 'become', 'U')	
to become soldiers@#%^&*('become', 'given', 'U')	
dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs.@#%^&*('dedicated', 'soldiers', 'U')	
Each gram of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world@#%^&*('bullet', 'ROOT', 'R')	('world', 'fight', 'U')	
who fight this terrible scourge.@#%^&*('fight', 'world', 'U')	
A crusade of NO to the consumption of drugs is imperative.@#%^&*('imperative', 'ROOT', 'R')

required for development,@#%^&*('required', 'approvals', 'U')	
and part of Kaufman & Broad's job will be to obtain such approvals.@#%^&*('be', 'received', 'U')	
The partnership runs the risk@#%^&*('runs', 'said', 'U')	
that it may not get the approvals for development,@#%^&*('get', 'runs', 'U')	
but in return, it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices,@#%^&*('buy', 'runs', 'U')	('buy', 'said', 'U')	('prices', 'result', 'U')	('can', 'result', 'U')

"There are really very few companies@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	('companies', 'have', 'U')

By setting up the joint venture,@#%^&*('setting', 'take', 'U')	
Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach@#%^&*('take', 'ROOT', 'R')	
of buying raw land,@#%^&*('buying', 'approach', 'U')	
while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet,@#%^&*('while', 'said', 'U')	('avoiding', 'said', 'U')	
Mr. Karatz said.@#%^&*('said', 'take', 'U')	
The company is putting up only 10% of the capital,@#%^&*('putting', 'ROOT', 'R')	
although it is responsible for providing management, planning and processing services to the joint venture.@#%^&*('responsible', 'putting', 'U')

At a private dinner Thursday, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. chief executive Frederick Joseph delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to officials of Prudential Insurance Co. of America.@#%^&*('delivered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Joseph conceded@#%^&*('conceded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the junk market was in disarray,@#%^&*('was', 'conceded', 'U')	
according to people familiar with the discussion.@#%^&*('to', 'was', 'U')	('people', 'was', 'U')	
He said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Drexel@#%^&*('Drexel', 'afford', 'U')	('Drexel', 'sell', 'U')	
-- the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds --@#%^&*('underwriter', 'Drexel', 'U')	
could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings@#%^&*('afford', 'said', 'U')	
if they might later become troubled@#%^&*('become', 'sell', 'U')	
because Drexel risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise.@#%^&*('risked', 'become', 'U')	
The dinner was a stark confirmation@#%^&*('confirmation', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that 1989 is the worst year ever for the $200 billion junk market.@#%^&*('year', 'confirmation', 'U')	
And investors and traders alike say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the current turmoil could take years to resolve.@#%^&*('take', 'say', 'U')	
Amid the market disorder, even Drexel,@#%^&*('disorder', 'pulling', 'U')	('Drexel', 'has', 'U')	('Drexel', 'pulling', 'U')	
which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors,@#%^&*('has', 'Drexel', 'U')	
is pulling in its horns.@#%^&*('pulling', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market,@#%^&*('dominates', 'unable', 'U')	
Drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults, withdrawn new offerings, redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors.@#%^&*('unable', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For many money managers, the past four months have been humiliating.@#%^&*('humiliating', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market,@#%^&*('shakeout', 'says', 'U')	
and it could take years before it's over,"@#%^&*('take', 'shakeout', 'U')	('take', 'says', 'U')	
says Mark Bachmann, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's Corp., a credit rating company.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In the third quarter, for example, junk bonds@#%^&*('quarter', 'showed', 'U')	('example', 'showed', 'U')	('bonds', 'showed', 'U')	
-- those with less than an investment-grade rating --@#%^&*('those', 'bonds', 'U')	
showed negative returns, the only major sector of the bond market@#%^&*('showed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('to', 'do', 'U')	
to do so.@#%^&*('do', 'showed', 'U')	
Since the end of last year, junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds,@#%^&*('outperformed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
including ultra-safe Treasury securities.@#%^&*('securities', 'categories', 'U')	
The junk market,@#%^&*('market', 'mushroomed', 'U')	('market', 'declining', 'U')	
which mushroomed to $200 billion from less than $2 billion at the start of the decade,@#%^&*('mushroomed', 'market', 'U')	
has been declining for months@#%^&*('declining', 'ROOT', 'R')	('as', 'stumbled', 'U')	
as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments.@#%^&*('stumbled', 'declining', 'U')	
The fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp.,@#%^&*('received', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Corp.', 'created', 'U')	
which created its U.S. retailing empire with more than $3 billion in junk financing.@#%^&*('created', 'Corp.', 'U')	
Campeau developed a cash squeeze@#%^&*('developed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('squeeze', 'caused', 'U')	
that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdale's department store chain up for sale.@#%^&*('caused', 'squeeze', 'U')	
At that point, the junk market went into a tailspin@#%^&*('went', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as buyers disappeared@#%^&*('disappeared', 'went', 'U')	
and investors tried to sell.@#%^&*('tried', 'went', 'U')	
In an interview, Mr. Joseph says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
his dinner discussion with the Prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk.@#%^&*('acknowledged', 'says', 'U')	
"What I thought@#%^&*('thought', 'is', 'U')	('I', 'saying', 'U')	
I was saying@#%^&*('saying', 'thought', 'U')	
is that the market is troubled but still viable and, appropriately enough, quite quality-conscious,@#%^&*('is', 'says', 'U')	
which is not at all bad,"@#%^&*('bad', 'troubled', 'U')	
he says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Nobody's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years,@#%^&*('perfect', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and we're going to make sure@#%^&*('going', 'perfect', 'U')	
our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market."@#%^&*('going', 'sure', 'U')	
What has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization@#%^&*('realization', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that junk bonds cannot necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds.@#%^&*('bought', 'realization', 'U')	('sold', 'realization', 'U')	
Unlike the New York Stock Exchange,@#%^&*('Exchange', 'closed', 'U')	
where buyers and sellers are quickly matched,@#%^&*('matched', 'closed', 'U')	
the junk market,@#%^&*('market', 'closed', 'U')	
where risky corporate loans are traded,@#%^&*('traded', 'market', 'U')	('is', 'closed', 'U')	
is sometimes closed for repairs.@#%^&*('closed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At closely held Deltec Securities Corp., junk bond money managers Amy K. Minella and Hannah H. Strasser say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise.@#%^&*('go', 'say', 'U')	
In recent months,@#%^&*('months', 'say', 'U')	
they say,@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market's traditional investors,@#%^&*('selling', 'say', 'U')	
while new buyers haven't materialized@#%^&*('buyers', 'replace', 'U')	('materialized', 'say', 'U')	
to replace them.@#%^&*('replace', 'materialized', 'U')	
Wall Street securities firms, "the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market," have been net sellers of junk bonds@#%^&*('sellers', 'said', 'U')	
because of trading losses,@#%^&*('losses', 'bonds', 'U')	
Deltec said in a recent, grim report to customers.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds@#%^&*('sellers', 'said', 'U')	
as junk's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced "above-normal" redemptions by shareholders,@#%^&*('produced', 'sellers', 'U')	
Deltec said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Investors,@#%^&*('Investors', 'sold', 'U')	
trying to raise cash,@#%^&*('trying', 'Investors', 'U')	
have sold "large liquid issues" such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co.;@#%^&*('sold', 'ROOT', 'R')	
declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market's distress.@#%^&*('contributed', 'sold', 'U')	
And,@#%^&*('And', 'reduced', 'U')	
Deltec said,@#%^&*('said', 'reduced', 'U')	
buying has been severely reduced@#%^&*('reduced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation.@#%^&*('restricted', 'reduced', 'U')	
"In fact, savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter,"@#%^&*('sellers', 'said', 'U')	
Deltec said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Ms. Minella and Ms. Strasser say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
they are managing their junk portfolios defensively,@#%^&*('they', 'building', 'U')	('they', 'upgrading', 'U')	('managing', 'say', 'U')	
building cash@#%^&*('building', 'say', 'U')	('building', 'managing', 'U')	
and selectively upgrading the overall quality.@#%^&*('upgrading', 'say', 'U')	('upgrading', 'managing', 'U')	
Meanwhile, Prudential, the nation's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds, has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $6.5 billion from $7 billion since August@#%^&*('seen', 'ROOT', 'R')	
because of falling junk prices.@#%^&*('prices', 'seen', 'U')	
"We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here,@#%^&*('have', 'says', 'U')	('it', 'something', 'U')	
and it's something@#%^&*('something', 'have', 'U')	('something', 'says', 'U')	
to be concerned about,"@#%^&*('concerned', 'something', 'U')	
says James A. Gregoire, a managing director.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"I have no reason@#%^&*('have', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to think@#%^&*('think', 'reason', 'U')	
things will get worse,@#%^&*('worse', 'think', 'U')	
but this market has a knack@#%^&*('has', 'have', 'U')	
for surprising us.@#%^&*('surprising', 'knack', 'U')	
This market teaches us to be humble."@#%^&*('teaches', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The junk market's "yield hogs are learning a real painful lesson,"@#%^&*('learning', 'says', 'U')	('he', 'says', 'U')	
he says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default,@#%^&*('show', 'downgraded', 'U')	('the', 'market', 'U')	
the market has downgraded many junk issues@#%^&*('downgraded', 'says', 'U')	('as', 'were', 'U')	
as if they were in trouble,@#%^&*('were', 'downgraded', 'U')	
says Stuart Reese, manager of Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's $17 billion investment-grade public bond portfolio.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"But we think@#%^&*('think', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the risks are there@#%^&*('risks', 'worse', 'U')	('are', 'worse', 'U')	('there', 'worse', 'U')	
for things getting a lot worse.@#%^&*('things', 'there', 'U')	('worse', 'think', 'U')	
And the risks aren't appropriate for us,"@#%^&*('And', 'says', 'U')	('appropriate', 'says', 'U')	('he', 'says', 'U')	
he says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The big insurer, unlike Prudential, owns only about $150 million of publicly sold junk bonds.@#%^&*('owns', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The string of big junk bond defaults,@#%^&*('string', 'cause', 'U')	('string', 'persist', 'U')	
which have been a major cause of the market's problems this year,@#%^&*('cause', 'string', 'U')	
probably will persist,@#%^&*('persist', 'say', 'U')	
some analysts say.@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"If anything, we're going to see defaults increase@#%^&*('going', 'says', 'U')	
because credit ratings have declined,"@#%^&*('declined', 'increase', 'U')	
says Paul Asquith, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Asquith,@#%^&*('Asquith', 'study', 'U')	('Asquith', 'says', 'U')	
whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street@#%^&*('caused', 'Asquith', 'U')	
when it was disclosed last April,@#%^&*('disclosed', 'caused', 'U')	
says@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
this year's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings.@#%^&*('show', 'says', 'U')	
His study showed@#%^&*('showed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34%.@#%^&*('had', 'showed', 'U')	
One indication of a growing number of junk defaults,@#%^&*('indication', 'is', 'U')	
Mr. Asquith says,@#%^&*('says', 'is', 'U')	
is that about half of the $3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	('bonds', 'lowered', 'U')	
that have been lowered to a default rating by S&P this year@#%^&*('lowered', 'bonds', 'U')	
are junk bonds@#%^&*('bonds', 'is', 'U')	
sold during the market's big issue years of 1984 through 1986.@#%^&*('sold', 'bonds', 'U')	
These bonds,@#%^&*('bonds', 'include', 'U')	
now rated single-D,@#%^&*('rated', 'bonds', 'U')	
include junk offerings by AP Industries, Columbia Savings@#%^&*('include', 'ROOT', 'R')

First Texas Savings Association, Gilbraltar Financial Corp., Integrated Resources Inc., Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp., Resorts International Inc., Southmark Corp. and Vyquest Inc.@#%^&*('Association', 'include', 'U')	('Association', 'Industries', 'U')	('Corp.', 'include', 'U')	('Corp.', 'Industries', 'U')	('Inc.', 'include', 'U')	('Inc.', 'Industries', 'U')	('Corp.', 'include', 'U')	('Corp.', 'Industries', 'U')	('Inc.', 'include', 'U')	('Inc.', 'Industries', 'U')	('Corp.', 'include', 'U')	('Corp.', 'Industries', 'U')	('Inc.', 'include', 'U')	('Inc.', 'Industries', 'U')	
"Obviously, we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people@#%^&*('got', 'says', 'U')	('people', 'told', 'U')	
who told us@#%^&*('told', 'people', 'U')	
the market wasn't so risky,"@#%^&*('risky', 'told', 'U')	
says Bradford Cornell, professor of finance at University of California's Anderson Graduate School of Management in Los Angeles.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Cornell has just completed a study@#%^&*('completed', 'ROOT', 'R')	('study', 'finds', 'U')	
that finds@#%^&*('finds', 'study', 'U')	('that', 'less', 'U')	
that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds.@#%^&*('less', 'finds', 'U')	('more', 'finds', 'U')	
Mr. Cornell says:@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"The junk market is no bonanza@#%^&*('bonanza', 'says', 'U')	
as Drexel claimed,@#%^&*('claimed', 'bonanza', 'U')	
but it also isn't a disaster@#%^&*('disaster', 'says', 'U')	('as', 'say', 'U')	
as the doomsayers say."@#%^&*('say', 'disaster', 'U')	
Despite the junk market's problems,@#%^&*('problems', 'continues', 'U')	
Drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors@#%^&*('continues', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that its Wall Street rivals haven't found.@#%^&*('found', 'enjoy', 'U')	
During the past three weeks, for example, Drexel has sold $1.3 billion of new junk bonds for Turner Broadcasting Co., Uniroyal Chemical, Continental Air and Duff & Phelps.@#%^&*('sold', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Still, the list of troubled Drexel bond offerings dwarfs that of any firm on Wall Street,@#%^&*('dwarfs', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as does its successful offerings.@#%^&*('does', 'dwarfs', 'U')	
Troubled Drexel-underwritten issues include Resorts International, Braniff, Integrated Resources, SCI TV, Gillette Holdings, Western Electric and Southmark.@#%^&*('include', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Quality junk bonds will continue to trade well,"@#%^&*('continue', 'says', 'U')

Are consumers too deep in hock?@#%^&*('deep', 'ROOT', 'R')	('A', 'lot', 'U')	
A lot of observers think so,@#%^&*('think', 'hock', 'U')	
and,@#%^&*('if', 'right', 'U')	
if they're right,@#%^&*('right', 'hurt', 'U')	('the', 'economy', 'U')	
the whole economy as well as the spendthrifts among us could be hurt.@#%^&*('hurt', 'deep', 'U')	
A sudden, forced cutback by consumers,@#%^&*('cutback', 'account', 'U')	('cutback', 'damp', 'U')	
who normally account for about two-thirds of economic activity,@#%^&*('account', 'cutback', 'U')	
would damp the economy at a time@#%^&*('damp', 'ROOT', 'R')	
when plant-and-equipment spending is slowing@#%^&*('slowing', 'damp', 'U')	
and deficit-racked governments can't readily take up the slack.@#%^&*('take', 'damp', 'U')	('take', 'slowing', 'U')	
And another wave of bad loans would further batter many already-shaky lending institutions.@#%^&*('batter', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The worriers cite some worrisome trends.@#%^&*('cite', 'ROOT', 'R')	
During the almost seven-year-old economic expansion, inflation-adjusted gross national product, disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen 30%,@#%^&*('risen', 'ROOT', 'R')	('inflation', 'credit', 'U')	
but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged 66%.@#%^&*('surged', 'risen', 'U')	
And the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income@#%^&*('And', 'hit', 'U')	('ratio', 'hit', 'U')	
-- personal income after taxes --@#%^&*
has hit a high of about 18 1/2%.@#%^&*('hit', 'ROOT', 'R')	
has hit a high of about 18 1/2%.@#%^&*
However, these figures don't seem to worry Thomas A. Durkin, an economist at the Federal Reserve Board.@#%^&*('seem', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In a paper@#%^&*('paper', 'comments', 'U')	
presented at the recent annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economists in San Francisco,@#%^&*('presented', 'paper', 'U')	
Mr. Durkin comments@#%^&*('comments', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that "installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances,@#%^&*('grows', 'comments', 'U')	
and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences."@#%^&*('typical', 'comments', 'U')	
He adds:@#%^&*('adds', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"We are now witnessing a slowdown@#%^&*('witnessing', 'adds', 'U')	('slowdown', 'persist', 'U')	
which,@#%^&*('if', 'guide', 'U')	
if history is a guide,@#%^&*('guide', 'persist', 'U')	
could persist for a while."@#%^&*('persist', 'slowdown', 'U')	
But what about the debt burden?@#%^&*('But', 'doubts', 'U')	('what', 'Durkin', 'U')	
Mr. Durkin doubts@#%^&*('doubts', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that "there is some magic level"@#%^&*('is', 'doubts', 'U')	('level', 'indicates', 'U')	('the', 'ratio', 'U')	
at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income "indicates economic problems."@#%^&*('indicates', 'level', 'U')	
And, "more importantly,"@#%^&*('And', 'measured', 'U')	('importantly', 'says', 'U')	
he says,@#%^&*('says', 'measured', 'U')	
"the debt burden@#%^&*('burden', 'measured', 'U')	
measured other ways@#%^&*('measured', 'ROOT', 'R')	('ways', 'is', 'U')	
is not really in uncharted waters."@#%^&*('is', 'measured', 'U')	
The chart below shows why@#%^&*('shows', 'ROOT', 'R')	
(see accompanying illustration@#%^&*('see', 'shows', 'U')	
-- WSJ Oct. 23, 1989).@#%^&*('WSJ', 'illustration', 'U')	
The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income, though up a bit, hasn't climbed steeply,@#%^&*('climbed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed.@#%^&*('changed', 'climbed', 'U')	
Moreover, the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be "lower in this cycle than earlier,"@#%^&*('lower', 'says', 'U')	
Mr. Durkin says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
He notes@#%^&*('notes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that some "revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit"@#%^&*('credit', 'notes', 'U')	
being used simply as a handy way@#%^&*('used', 'credit', 'U')	
of paying bills@#%^&*('paying', 'way', 'U')	
rather than a handy way@#%^&*('rather', 'paying', 'U')	('way', 'paying', 'U')	
of borrowing.@#%^&*('borrowing', 'way', 'U')	
In addition, he says,@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden."@#%^&*('boost', 'says', 'U')	
And@#%^&*('And', 'due', 'U')	
if you "consider the changing distribution of credit,"@#%^&*('consider', 'due', 'U')	
Mr. Durkin says,@#%^&*('says', 'due', 'U')	
"much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by higher-income families,"@#%^&*('due', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that is, "those probably best able to handle it."@#%^&*
Citing figures on home-equity loans,@#%^&*('Citing', 'notes', 'U')	
he notes@#%^&*('notes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that "11% of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts,@#%^&*('had', 'notes', 'U')	
but the proportion rises to 16% of homeowners in the $45,000-$60,000 income range and 23% of homeowners with income above $60,000."@#%^&*('rises', 'notes', 'U')	
And much home-equity credit is used conservatively.@#%^&*('used', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"The most frequent use is home improvement,@#%^&*('improvement', 'improves', 'U')	('improvement', 'says', 'U')	
which presumably improves the value of the property,"@#%^&*('improves', 'improvement', 'U')	
Mr. Durkin says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
So, it isn't surprising that consumer-credit delinquencies at banks remain,@#%^&*('surprising', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as the chart shows,@#%^&*('shows', 'surprising', 'U')	
reassuringly below some earlier highs@#%^&*('reassuringly', 'shows', 'U')	('highs', 'shows', 'U')	
(see accompanying illustration@#%^&*('see', 'surprising', 'U')	
-- WSJ Oct. 23, 1989).@#%^&*('WSJ', 'illustration', 'U')	
A severe recession could, of course, raise delinquency rates,@#%^&*('raise', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but so far the current levels of consumer debt don't seem to loom as a major threat.@#%^&*('seem', 'raise', 'U')	
In fact, the current weakness in auto buying and department-store sales and the gradual upturn in the household saving rate suggest@#%^&*('suggest', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that consumers, conservative as ever, are already clutching their purses a bit more tightly.@#%^&*('clutching', 'suggest', 'U')	
In July, consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since January 1987.@#%^&*('fell', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Consumers appear unwilling to add to their leverage@#%^&*('appear', 'says', 'U')	('to', 'support', 'U')	
to support their spending,"@#%^&*('support', 'leverage', 'U')	
Bruce Steinberg, a Merrill Lynch economist, says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"As a result, household debt appears to be stabilizing at around 63% of GNP."@#%^&*('appears', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Consumers, credit cards in hand, aren't running amok through the shopping malls@#%^&*('Consumers', 'putting', 'U')	('running', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- or putting the economy at any great risk.@#%^&*('putting', 'running', 'U')

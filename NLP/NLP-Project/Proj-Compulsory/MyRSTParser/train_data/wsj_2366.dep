IOWA IS MAKING a comeback.@#%^&*('MAKING', 'ROOT', 'R')	
So are Indiana, Ohio and Michigan.@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The population of all four states is on the upswing,@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	('upswing', 'following', 'U')	
according to new Census Bureau estimates,@#%^&*('to', 'following', 'U')	('estimates', 'following', 'U')	
following declines throughout the early 1980s.@#%^&*('following', 'is', 'U')	
The gains,@#%^&*('gains', 'small', 'U')	
to be sure,@#%^&*('sure', 'small', 'U')	
are rather small.@#%^&*('small', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Iowa, for instance, saw its population grow by 11,000 people, or 0.4%, between 1987 and 1988,@#%^&*('saw', 'says', 'U')	
the Census Bureau says.@#%^&*('says', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Still, even that modest increase is good news for a state@#%^&*('news', 'ROOT', 'R')	('state', 'grown', 'U')	
that hadn't grown at all since 1981.@#%^&*('grown', 'state', 'U')	
Between 1987 and 1988, North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest@#%^&*('state', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people.@#%^&*('lose', 'Midwest', 'U')	
Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980@#%^&*('growing', 'ROOT', 'R')

The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race.@#%^&*('holding', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980,@#%^&*('grown', 'ROOT', 'R')	
including New York,@#%^&*('York', 'grown', 'U')	('York', 'lost', 'U')	
which lost 4% of its population during the 1970s.@#%^&*('lost', 'York', 'U')	
And@#%^&*('And', 'growing', 'U')	
although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade,@#%^&*('suffered', 'growing', 'U')	
they are growing again.@#%^&*('growing', 'ROOT', 'R')	
At the same time, several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround.@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Seven states@#%^&*('states', 'grew', 'U')	('states', 'losing', 'U')	
that grew in the early 1980s@#%^&*('grew', 'states', 'U')	
are now losing population@#%^&*('losing', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- West Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, Wyoming and Alaska.@#%^&*('Virginia', 'population', 'U')	('Mississippi', 'population', 'U')	('Louisiana', 'population', 'U')	('Oklahoma', 'population', 'U')	('Montana', 'population', 'U')	('Wyoming', 'population', 'U')	('Alaska', 'population', 'U')	
Overall, though, the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest,@#%^&*('outpace', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure@#%^&*('ensure', 'outpace', 'U')	
that the pattern will continue.@#%^&*('continue', 'ensure', 'U')	
But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing.@#%^&*('started', 'ROOT', 'R')

A new Census Bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows@#%^&*('shows', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that 64% of people@#%^&*('that', 'living', 'U')	('%', 'living', 'U')	
aged 65 to 74@#%^&*('aged', 'people', 'U')	
were living with a spouse in 1988, up from 59% in 1970.@#%^&*('living', 'shows', 'U')	
This doesn't mean they're less likely to live alone, however.@#%^&*('mean', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That share has remained at about 24% since 1970.@#%^&*('remained', 'ROOT', 'R')	
What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children.@#%^&*('is', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In 1988, 10% of those@#%^&*('1988', 'lived', 'U')	('%', 'lived', 'U')	('those', 'aged', 'U')	
aged 65 to 74@#%^&*('aged', '%', 'U')

The likelihood@#%^&*('likelihood', 'increased', 'U')	
of living alone beyond the age of 75@#%^&*('living', 'likelihood', 'U')	
has increased to 40% from 32%.@#%^&*('increased', 'ROOT', 'R')

From the Sept. 30-Oct. 4 issue of The Economist:@#%^&*('issue', 'weight', 'U')	('Economist', 'defeated', 'U')	
What defeated General Aoun was not only the weight of the Syrian army.@#%^&*('defeated', 'Economist', 'U')	('weight', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The weight of Lebanon's history was also against him;@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and it is a history@#%^&*('history', 'was', 'U')	
Israel is in danger@#%^&*('is', 'history', 'U')	
of repeating.@#%^&*('repeating', 'danger', 'U')	
Like Lebanon, and however unfairly, Israel is regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration.@#%^&*('regarded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the Palestinians.@#%^&*('lies', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Like Lebanon, Israel is being remade by demography.@#%^&*('remade', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In Greater Israel more than half the children under six are Muslims.@#%^&*('Muslims', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Within 25 years Jews will probably be the minority.@#%^&*('minority', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Yet Israel will neither share power with all these Arabs@#%^&*('Israel', 'redraw', 'U')	('share', 'ROOT', 'R')	
nor,@#%^&*('says', 'share', 'U')	
says its present prime minister,@#%^&*('says', 'redraw', 'U')	
redraw its borders closer to its pre-1967 Jewish heartland.@#%^&*('redraw', 'share', 'U')	
By not choosing one of these options,@#%^&*('choosing', 'condemn', 'U')	
Israelis will condemn themselves,@#%^&*('condemn', 'ROOT', 'R')	
as the Maronites did,@#%^&*('did', 'condemn', 'U')	('did', 'condemn', 'U')	
to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst, and so to the internal erosion of their state.@#%^&*('war', 'did', 'U')	('Muslims', 'did', 'U')	('midst', 'did', 'U')	('erosion', 'did', 'U')	
Unlike the Maronites, Israel's Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies;@#%^&*('let', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Jerusalem will become Belfast@#%^&*('become', 'let', 'U')	
before it becomes Beirut.@#%^&*
But that is not much of a consolation@#%^&*('much', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to draw from the failure of General Aoun.@#%^&*('draw', 'consolation', 'U')

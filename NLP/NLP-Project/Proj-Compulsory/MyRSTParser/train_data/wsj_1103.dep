Boston Co., the upper-crust financial services concern@#%^&*('Co.', 'had', 'U')	('concern', 'rocked', 'U')	
that was rocked by a management scandal late last year,@#%^&*('rocked', 'concern', 'U')	
has had a sharp drop in profitability@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- mainly because a high-risk bet on interest rates backfired.@#%^&*('backfired', 'had', 'U')	('backfired', 'had', 'U')	
Boston Co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent, Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.,@#%^&*('news', 'ROOT', 'R')	('parent', 'relied', 'U')	
which has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit's contributions in recent years.@#%^&*('relied', 'parent', 'U')	
In 1988, for example, Boston Co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $110 million,@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
while Shearson managed net income of just $96 million.@#%^&*('managed', 'had', 'U')	
Shearson doesn't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries.@#%^&*('break', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But people familiar with Boston Co. 's performance say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the unit had profit of around $17 million for the third quarter,@#%^&*('had', 'say', 'U')	
after barely breaking even for the first six months.@#%^&*('breaking', 'had', 'U')	
Shearson, meanwhile, posted net income of $106 million for the first nine months of the year, down slightly from $110 million for the year-ago period.@#%^&*('posted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Moody's Investors Service Inc. last week downgraded the long-term deposit rating of Boston Co. 's Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co. subsidiary, to single-A-1 from double-A-3,@#%^&*('downgraded', 'ROOT', 'R')	
citing problems in the company's "aggressively managed securities portfolio."@#%^&*('citing', 'downgraded', 'U')	
John Kriz, a Moody's vice president, said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Boston Safe Deposit's performance has been hurt this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities.@#%^&*('hurt', 'said', 'U')	
The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk,@#%^&*('exposed', 'said', 'U')	
and@#%^&*('when', 'moved', 'U')	
when rates moved unfavorably@#%^&*('moved', 'cost', 'U')	
-- beginning late last year@#%^&*('beginning', 'cost', 'U')	
and continuing into this year --@#%^&*('continuing', 'beginning', 'U')	('continuing', 'cost', 'U')	
"it cost them,"@#%^&*('cost', 'exposed', 'U')	('cost', 'said', 'U')	
Mr. Kriz said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Mr. Kriz noted@#%^&*('noted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Boston Safe Deposit "has taken some actions@#%^&*('taken', 'noted', 'U')	('to', 'control', 'U')	
to better control asset-liability management@#%^&*('control', 'taken', 'U')	
and improve controls in general,@#%^&*('improve', 'taken', 'U')	
and we think@#%^&*('think', 'noted', 'U')	
these will serve to improve credit quality."@#%^&*('serve', 'think', 'U')	
As some securities mature@#%^&*('mature', 'ought', 'U')	
and the proceeds are reinvested,@#%^&*('reinvested', 'mature', 'U')	('reinvested', 'ought', 'U')	('the', 'problems', 'U')	
the problems ought to ease,@#%^&*('ought', 'said', 'U')	('he', 'said', 'U')	
he said.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But he also cited concerns over the company's mortgage exposure in the troubled New England real estate market.@#%^&*('cited', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Boston Co. officials declined to comment on Moody's action or on the unit's financial performance this year@#%^&*('officials', 'deny', 'U')	('declined', 'ROOT', 'R')	
-- except to deny a published report@#%^&*('deny', 'comment', 'U')	('deny', 'comment', 'U')	('deny', 'comment', 'U')	
that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters' results.@#%^&*('discovered', 'deny', 'U')	
An accounting controversy at the end of last year forced Boston Co. to admit@#%^&*('forced', 'ROOT', 'R')	('it', 'overstated', 'U')	
it had overstated pretax profits by some $44 million.@#%^&*('overstated', 'admit', 'U')	
The resulting scandal led to the firing of James N. von Germeten as Boston Co. 's president and to the resignations of the company's chief financial officer and treasurer.@#%^&*('led', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The executives were accused of improperly deferring expenses and booking revenue early, in an effort@#%^&*('accused', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to dress up results@#%^&*('dress', 'effort', 'U')	
-- and perhaps bolster performance-related bonuses.@#%^&*('bolster', 'effort', 'U')	('bolster', 'dress', 'U')	
Mr. von Germeten, in turn, attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants@#%^&*('Germeten', 'accused', 'U')	('attributed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and accused Shearson of conducting a "witch hunt."@#%^&*('accused', 'attributed', 'U')	
Mr. Kriz of Moody's said@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions@#%^&*('stem', 'said', 'U')	
taken last year.@#%^&*('taken', 'positions', 'U')	
The company's current management found itself "locked into this,"@#%^&*('found', 'said', 'U')	('he', 'said', 'U')

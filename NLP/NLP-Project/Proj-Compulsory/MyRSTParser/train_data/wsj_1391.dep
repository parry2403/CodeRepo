China could exhaust its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year,@#%^&*('exhaust', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'report', 'U')	
a Western government report says,@#%^&*('says', 'exhaust', 'U')	
unless imports are cut drastically@#%^&*('imports', 'help', 'U')	('cut', 'exhaust', 'U')	
to help narrow the balance-of-payments deficit.@#%^&*('help', 'cut', 'U')	
According to the report,@#%^&*('to', 'wiped', 'U')	('report', 'wiped', 'U')	
completed last month,@#%^&*('completed', 'report', 'U')	
if China's trade gap continues to widen at the pace@#%^&*('continues', 'wiped', 'U')	
seen in the first seven months of this year,@#%^&*('seen', 'pace', 'U')	('the', 'reserves', 'U')	
the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991.@#%^&*('wiped', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A country is considered financially healthy@#%^&*('considered', 'ROOT', 'R')	
if its reserves cover three months of its imports.@#%^&*('cover', 'considered', 'U')	
The $14 billion of reserves@#%^&*('$', 'cover', 'U')	
China had in June@#%^&*('had', 'reserves', 'U')	
would cover just that much.@#%^&*('cover', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The report by the Western government,@#%^&*('report', 'declines', 'U')	('report', 'identified', 'U')	('report', 'concludes', 'U')	
which declines to be identified,@#%^&*('declines', 'report', 'U')	
concludes that@#%^&*('concludes', 'ROOT', 'R')	('that', 'avoided', 'U')	('a', 'problem', 'U')	
"a near-term foreign-exchange payment problem can be avoided@#%^&*('avoided', 'concludes', 'U')	
only if import growth drops to below 5% per annum."@#%^&*('drops', 'avoided', 'U')	
According to Chinese customs figures,@#%^&*('to', 'slowed', 'U')	('figures', 'slowed', 'U')	
import growth has slowed in recent months,@#%^&*('slowed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
dropping to 16% in July and 7.1% in August from the year-earlier periods,@#%^&*('dropping', 'slowed', 'U')	
compared with an average growth rate of 26% in the first half.@#%^&*('with', 'slowed', 'U')	('rate', 'slowed', 'U')	
But@#%^&*('But', 'taken', 'U')	
before import growth slowed,@#%^&*('slowed', 'taken', 'U')	
China's buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves.@#%^&*('taken', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The $14 billion level in June marked a drop from $19 billion at the end of April.@#%^&*('marked', 'ROOT', 'R')	
China's last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to $10.6 billion in June 1985 from $16.6 billion the previous September.@#%^&*('sent', 'ROOT', 'R')	
China might stave off a crisis@#%^&*('stave', 'ROOT', 'R')	
if it acts as forcefully@#%^&*('it', 'devalued', 'U')	('acts', 'stave', 'U')	('as', 'did', 'U')	('it', 'did', 'U')	('it', 'arrest', 'U')	
as it did@#%^&*('did', 'forcefully', 'U')	('did', 'forcefully', 'U')	
to arrest the 1985 decline,@#%^&*('arrest', 'did', 'U')	('decline', 'slammed', 'U')	
when Beijing slammed the brakes on foreign-exchange spending@#%^&*('slammed', 'decline', 'U')	
and devalued the currency.@#%^&*('devalued', 'stave', 'U')	('devalued', 'acts', 'U')	
But this time, China faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces@#%^&*('faces', 'ROOT', 'R')	('battle', 'come', 'U')	
that have come into play since the Tiananmen Square killings June 4.@#%^&*('come', 'battle', 'U')	
For example, China's hard-currency income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since June 4.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Revenue from tourism this year is projected to total $1.3 billion, down from $2.2 billion last year.@#%^&*('projected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Because of this and the huge trade gap, the deficit in China's current account,@#%^&*('of', 'expected', 'U')	('this', 'expected', 'U')	('gap', 'expected', 'U')	('deficit', 'measures', 'U')	('deficit', 'expected', 'U')	('deficit', 'widen', 'U')	
which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds,@#%^&*('measures', 'deficit', 'U')	
is expected to widen sharply from the $3.8 billion deficit last year.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Western government report suggests a number of scenarios for China's current-account balance, two of which are considered most likely.@#%^&*('suggests', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In one, imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of 25% and 5%@#%^&*('continue', 'ROOT', 'R')	
recorded during the first seven months,@#%^&*('recorded', '%', 'U')	('the', 'deficit', 'U')	
and the current-account deficit widens to $13.1 billion.@#%^&*('widens', 'continue', 'U')	
In 1985, China had a record deficit of $11.4 billion.@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The other scenario assumes@#%^&*('assumes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
that Beijing takes effective actions@#%^&*('takes', 'assumes', 'U')	
to curb imports in the coming months.@#%^&*('curb', 'takes', 'U')	
In this case, China would still finish the year with a current-account deficit of $8.7 billion,@#%^&*('finish', 'ROOT', 'R')	
based on projections@#%^&*('projections', 'finish', 'U')	
that imports for all of this year grow 20% and exports 10%.@#%^&*('grow', 'projections', 'U')	('exports', 'projections', 'U')	
If China were still on good terms with foreign lenders,@#%^&*('were', 'able', 'U')	('it', 'able', 'U')	('it', 'stem', 'U')	
it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves@#%^&*('able', 'ROOT', 'R')	
by using some loan funds@#%^&*('using', 'stem', 'U')	
to offset the current-account deficit.@#%^&*('offset', 'using', 'U')	
But since June, foreign bankers@#%^&*('But', 'suspended', 'U')	('June', 'suspended', 'U')	('bankers', 'suspended', 'U')	
led by international financial institutions@#%^&*('led', 'bankers', 'U')	
have virtually suspended their new loans to China.@#%^&*('suspended', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Even if borrowing resumes,@#%^&*('resumes', 'expected', 'U')	
commercial bankers aren't expected to lend as much as before.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In addition, economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments@#%^&*('forecasting', 'ROOT', 'R')	('as', 'become', 'U')	
as businessmen become increasingly wary of China's deteriorating political and economic environment.@#%^&*('become', 'forecasting', 'U')	
On top of all this, foreign-debt repayments are expected to peak in 1991 to 1992.@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
With less capital coming in,@#%^&*('capital', 'suffer', 'U')	
China's balance of payments would suffer.@#%^&*('suffer', 'ROOT', 'R')	
The Western government report's first scenario assumes a 30% reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5% contraction in foreign direct investment.@#%^&*('assumes', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In the second, foreign borrowing is projected to grow 10% and investment to drop 10%.@#%^&*('projected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But in either case,@#%^&*('But', 'dry', 'U')	('case', 'dry', 'U')	('the', 'report', 'U')	
the report says,@#%^&*('says', 'dry', 'U')	
China's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves,@#%^&*('dry', 'ROOT', 'R')	('reserves', 'used', 'U')	('reserves', 'finance', 'U')	
which are used@#%^&*('used', 'reserves', 'U')	
to finance the imbalance.@#%^&*('finance', 'used', 'U')	
In the first scenario, the reserves would be exhausted next year,@#%^&*('exhausted', 'ROOT', 'R')	('the', 'second', 'U')	
and in the second they would be wiped out in 1991.@#%^&*('wiped', 'exhausted', 'U')

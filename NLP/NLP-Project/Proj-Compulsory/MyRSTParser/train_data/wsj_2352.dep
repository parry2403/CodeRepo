The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the Arcadian Phosphate case did not repudiate the position@#%^&*('repudiate', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Pennzoil Co. took in its dispute with Texaco,@#%^&*('took', 'position', 'U')	
contrary to your Sept. 8 article "Court Backs Texaco's View in Pennzoil Case@#%^&*('contrary', 'took', 'U')	
-- Too Late."@#%^&*('Late', 'took', 'U')	
The fundamental rule of contract law@#%^&*('rule', 'was', 'U')	
applied to both cases@#%^&*('applied', 'law', 'U')	
was that courts will not enforce agreements@#%^&*('was', 'ROOT', 'R')	('agreements', 'intend', 'U')	
to which the parties did not intend to be bound.@#%^&*('intend', 'agreements', 'U')	
In the Pennzoil/Texaco litigation, the courts found@#%^&*('found', 'ROOT', 'R')	('Pennzoil', 'Oil', 'U')	
Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound;@#%^&*('Oil', 'found', 'U')	
in Arcadian Phosphates@#%^&*('Phosphates', 'found', 'U')	
they found@#%^&*
there was no intention to be bound.@#%^&*('was', 'found', 'U')	
Admittedly, the principle in the cases is the same.@#%^&*('same', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts.@#%^&*('turns', 'ROOT', 'R')	
And the facts,@#%^&*('And', 'different', 'U')	('facts', 'different', 'U')	
as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits,@#%^&*('found', 'facts', 'U')	
were different.@#%^&*('different', 'ROOT', 'R')	
When you suggest otherwise,@#%^&*('suggest', 'leave', 'U')	('you', 'leave', 'U')	('you', 'enter', 'U')	
you leave the realm of reporting@#%^&*('leave', 'ROOT', 'R')	
and enter the orbit of speculation.@#%^&*('enter', 'leave', 'U')

The oil industry's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year.@#%^&*('persist', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings@#%^&*('expected', 'ROOT', 'R')	
than they did for the third quarter a year ago,@#%^&*('did', 'report', 'U')	
largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability.@#%^&*('reflecting', 'did', 'U')	
The gasoline picture may improve this quarter,@#%^&*('improve', 'ROOT', 'R')	
but chemicals are likely to remain weak,@#%^&*('likely', 'improve', 'U')	
industry executives and analysts say,@#%^&*('say', 'weak', 'U')	
reducing chances@#%^&*('reducing', 'weak', 'U')	
that profits could equal their year-earlier performance.@#%^&*('equal', 'remain', 'U')	
The industry is "seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals,"@#%^&*('seeing', 'said', 'U')	('certainly', 'said', 'U')	
Glenn Cox, president of Phillips Petroleum Co., said in an interview.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings" for the industry in general,@#%^&*('impact', 'added', 'U')	('he', 'added', 'U')	
he added.@#%^&*('added', 'ROOT', 'R')	
He didn't forecast Phillips's results.@#%^&*('forecast', 'ROOT', 'R')	
But securities analysts say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices@#%^&*('Phillips', 'post', 'U')	('be', 'say', 'U')	('will', 'post', 'U')	
and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings.@#%^&*('post', 'say', 'U')	('post', 'be', 'U')	
So, too,@#%^&*('So', 'predict', 'U')	('too', 'predict', 'U')	
many analysts predict,@#%^&*('predict', 'will', 'U')	
will Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp.@#%^&*('will', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene, a major commodity chemical@#%^&*('is', 'produced', 'U')	('chemical', 'produced', 'U')	
produced in vast amounts by many oil companies.@#%^&*('produced', 'ROOT', 'R')	
It has plunged 13% since July to around 26 cents a pound.@#%^&*('plunged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
A year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents,@#%^&*('sold', 'ROOT', 'R')	
peaking at about 34 cents last December.@#%^&*('peaking', 'sold', 'U')	
A big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion.@#%^&*('overexpansion', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Beginning in mid-1987,@#%^&*('Beginning', 'began', 'U')	
prices began accelerating@#%^&*('began', 'ROOT', 'R')	('a', 'economy', 'U')	
as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand.@#%^&*('economy', 'accelerating', 'U')	('dollar', 'accelerating', 'U')	
Companies added capacity furiously.@#%^&*('added', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Now, greatly increased supplies are on the market,@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	
while the dollar is stronger,@#%^&*('stronger', 'are', 'U')	
and domestic economic growth is slower.@#%^&*('slower', 'are', 'U')	
Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker.@#%^&*('weaker', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year@#%^&*('good', 'said', 'U')	
and generally not very good this year,"@#%^&*('generally', 'said', 'U')	
said William Randol, a securities analyst at First Boston Corp.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Oil company refineries ran flat out@#%^&*('ran', 'ROOT', 'R')	
to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August@#%^&*('prepare', 'flat', 'U')	('season', 'materialize', 'U')	
that didn't materialize.@#%^&*('materialize', 'season', 'U')	
The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period.@#%^&*('pushed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In addition, crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier,@#%^&*('addition', 'pressuring', 'U')	('prices', 'pressuring', 'U')	('were', 'pressuring', 'U')	('some', 'pressuring', 'U')	('year', 'pressuring', 'U')	
further pressuring profitability.@#%^&*('pressuring', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Refiners say@#%^&*('say', 'ROOT', 'R')	
margins picked up in September,@#%^&*('picked', 'say', 'U')	
and many industry officials believe@#%^&*('believe', 'say', 'U')	
gasoline profits will rebound this quarter, though still not to the level of 1988's fourth quarter.@#%^&*('rebound', 'believe', 'U')	
During the 1988 second half, many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits.@#%^&*('posted', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies' earnings this year.@#%^&*('turn', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Prices@#%^&*('Prices', 'stayed', 'U')	
-- averaging roughly $2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier --@#%^&*('averaging', 'Prices', 'U')	
have stayed well above most companies' expectations.@#%^&*('stayed', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Demand has been much stronger@#%^&*('stronger', 'ROOT', 'R')	
than anticipated,@#%^&*('anticipated', 'stronger', 'U')	
and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter.@#%^&*('accelerates', 'stronger', 'U')	
"We could see higher oil prices this year,"@#%^&*('see', 'said', 'U')	
said Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
That will translate into sharply higher production profits,@#%^&*('translate', 'ROOT', 'R')	
particularly compared with last year@#%^&*('particularly', 'translate', 'U')	('with', 'translate', 'U')	('year', 'translate', 'U')	
when oil prices steadily fell to below $13 a barrel in the fourth quarter.@#%^&*('fell', 'year', 'U')	
While oil prices have been better@#%^&*('While', 'expected', 'U')	('prices', 'expected', 'U')	('have', 'expected', 'U')	('been', 'expected', 'U')	('better', 'than', 'U')	
than expected,@#%^&*('expected', 'worse', 'U')	
natural gas prices have been worse.@#%^&*('worse', 'ROOT', 'R')	
In the third quarter, they averaged about 5% less@#%^&*('averaged', 'ROOT', 'R')	
than they were in 1988.@#%^&*('were', 'less', 'U')	
The main reason remains weather.@#%^&*('remains', 'ROOT', 'R')	
Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought@#%^&*('notable', 'ROOT', 'R')	('wave', 'caused', 'U')	('drought', 'caused', 'U')	
that caused utilities to burn more natural gas@#%^&*('caused', 'wave', 'U')	('to', 'feed', 'U')	
to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use.@#%^&*('feed', 'burn', 'U')	
This summer, on the other hand, had milder weather than usual.@#%^&*('had', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"We've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices,"@#%^&*('disappointed', 'said', 'U')	
said Mr. Cox, Phillips's president.@#%^&*('said', 'ROOT', 'R')	
"The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance@#%^&*('going', 'ROOT', 'R')	('as', 'expected', 'U')	
as many had expected."@#%^&*('expected', 'assist', 'U')	
Going into the fourth quarter,@#%^&*('Going', 'are', 'U')	
natural gas prices are anywhere from 8% to 17% lower than a year earlier.@#%^&*('are', 'ROOT', 'R')	
For instance, natural gas@#%^&*('instance', 'selling', 'U')	('gas', 'selling', 'U')	
currently produced along the Gulf Coast@#%^&*('produced', 'gas', 'U')	
is selling on the spot market for around $1.47 a thousand cubic feet, down 13% from $1.69 a thousand cubic feet a year ago.@#%^&*('selling', 'ROOT', 'R')
